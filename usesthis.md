## Health

### Home gym

+ [AMAZE Multipurpose Exercise Flat Bench](https://www.amazon.in/INFINITY-FITNESSTM-Multipurpose-Exercise-Capacity/dp/B07WYXYWLW/): Extremely fuddu bench but I needed something to do chest workouts. Can't wait to get a better bench. Most Amazon gym equipments are low quality. My plan is to use these for 6 months and then spend more and get better stuff from local retailers.

+ [USI Universal Power Lifting Belt PLH](https://www.amazon.in/USI-Power-Lifting-Belt-Heavy/dp/B01NAAWBQI/): For deadlifts.

+ [Dolphy Exercise Spinning Bike](https://www.amazon.in/Dolphy-Exercise-Spinning-Indoor-Cycling/dp/B07WP5FHXB/): Not using this as much as I would have liked.

+ [Fitlastics Resistance Loop Bands](https://www.amazon.in/Fitlastics-Resistance-Pilates-Fitness-Workouts/dp/B07XTCPHTM/): These are very good for warming up. You can even use them as replacement for weights.

+ [Wrist Wrap Gloves](https://www.amazon.in/Xtrim-Macho-Leather-Workout-Gloves/dp/B01N6Y6Z4N/): Highly recommend this one.

+ [Push-up Bars](https://www.amazon.in/GOCART-Push-up-Bars-Comfortable-Non-Slip/dp/B07FP14HQ1/): Like my bike, this is something which is mostly lying unused. Should not have bought them.
