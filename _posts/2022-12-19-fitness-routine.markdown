title:  "Fitness routine"
---

Instead of sticking to some strict exercise regimen, I have started looking at my routine as picking items from a food buffet. Some days I would do the posture reset multiple times, sometimes I will do 30-40 min mobility. Other days I will do [cycling](https://www.youtube.com/@GCNTraining), other times strength training from [Fitbod](https://fitbod.me/).

For mobility I use the following apps:
- [Streching app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stretch-flexibility-at-home/id1412615103)
- [Stretch Club](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1531580935#?platform=iphone)
- [Nike Training Club](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nike-training-club-fitness/id301521403)

I am paying for Fitbod and Stretching app. I would say Nike Training Club is more than enough, and you can choose not to pay for these. Fitbod I still might renew because it is the only strength training app I use. I can use Youtube videos too, but I like to use the app for tracking, and also knowing that I have paid for Fitbod makes me want to work out more. Sunk cost fallacy, but this time for a good cause. For most of this year, I played football 2/3 times a week. But with persistent injuries, I might cut down next year.

My source of record for all things training is my Apple watch. I log all my exercises there.
