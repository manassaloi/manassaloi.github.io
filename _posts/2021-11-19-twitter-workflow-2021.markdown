title:  "Twitter workflow - 2021"
---

- Use two accounts: main and alt.
- Alt is actually my wife's alt that I use because I am too lazy to create another account.
- Main account is for posting my thoughts. To cut my need to post every thought I have, I have given control of my account to my wife. I don't even know the password anymore. When I want to post something, I get my wife to login to my account on incognito. The tab remains open till I am done with my tweets and replies.
- I don't follow any account or lists on both my main and alt accounts.
- Why do I even need an alt account? So that I don't keep tweeting whole day with my main.
- I don't care if I spend a few hours on Twitter as long as I don't spend them arguing with random people who disagree with something I posted.
- I use Twitter on Chrome. I don't use the apps.
- Since I don't have notifications, I search for my name and my website URL so that I know if someone tagged me or shared something I wrote. I find it polite to reply if someone went out the way to share and comment on something I wrote.
- I have like 5 accounts I search for daily: all meme accounts. I check if they tweeted something new. Then I go to their Likes section for discovery. I wrote about this workflow [here](https://manassaloi.com/2020/03/25/interesting-reads.html).
- I track my twitter rants in the loop habit tracker app. I feel very happy if I manage to skip tweeting for a day or two.
- I hate spending so much time on Twitter, but I have to admit [I am hooked](https://manassaloi.com/2021/09/14/twitter-games.html).
