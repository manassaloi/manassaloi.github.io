A lot of people are selling courses on how to grow an online audience. Why spend money when I can give you the playbook for free.

[Lessons from observing online behavior for the last 15 years. Every platform is different, but tricks can be the same.]

1. Build bots for upcoming popular accounts. Everyone loves flattery. Why should the world be restricted to a naval bot? How will this help: People love their own shit, but retweeting their own stuff multiple times is lame. Retweeting tweets by a bot solves this problem. The original account has to tweet enough truisms for this hack to work. More thought leadership, less personal stuff.  It would be weird if the bot tweeted stuff about the author complaining about his loose motions or something. Remember to out your own account in the bio of this bot.

2. I know someone who reached 10s of thousands of followers/millions of page views on Quora by just copy-pasting answers from Reddit. You don't need any original insight or experience to hack engagement. Just know the stuff your audience will lap up.

3. Reddit answers sound boring? Why not summarise blog posts of popular accounts and then tag them + dozen other accounts? Remember to put [for visibility] on your tweet.

4. Someone who was a top writer on Quora used to mass follow accounts, get follows back, and then unfollow them. Most people won't remember to retaliate. Try this evergreen trick. What is old will be new again.

5. Post saas facts. Always a winner.
  - [Hot company X] grew their users by [Y]. Only possible in software.
  - [Hot company X] grew their valuation by [Y]. Only possible in a remote-first world.

People love saas. Always remember this.

6. Why should the Pomp brothers have all the fun? Business lessons from sportsmen are taken? Why not share business lessons from musicians? Or business lessons from world leaders? Everyone loves business lessons. Don't spend hours researching. Just check Reddit. Tons of business stories there.

7. Have a template ready for big events. What has X taught us about Y?  <-- A very popular template once upon a time, now forgotten.
  - What does Meghan Markle teach us about emotional intelligence as a business leader?
  - 5 lessons from Virat Kohli that you can use as a startup CEO.
  - 10 lessons from the Indo-China conflict that will help you in negotiating a term sheet with your VC.

8. A lot of popular accounts' growth is a function of truly supporting one side of the narrative. Follow the simple playbook mentioned here for max success: [Life Math Money playbook](https://manassaloi.com/2020/01/30/life-math-money.html)

9. Become the mega supporter of a popular account. Always reply to their tweets. See ParikPatelCFA and Chamath. You know a lot of people love and hate Chamath equally. So his posts will always get massive distribution. Use a popular account for your own growth.

10. Remember the first hack about creating a bot? Too lazy? Then just tweet out content by popular accounts. Remember to tag them.

Template: [Truism or popular thought attributed to some thought leader] - [Thought leader name tagged].

These are the 10 hacks. Try them for massive success. Don't let your lack of life experience prevent you from following your dreams/ building your network.

P.S Not hating on anyone. If I had a course to sell or wanted to build a distribution channel on Twitter or Quora, I would do the same.
