title:  "Random Design Gyaan - Ticker on Swiggy"

---

A collection of random thoughts on product design which I shared recently on Twitter

### Ticker on Swiggy

Love how Swiggy uses a ticker to show more info in the ratings section of the restaurant page. The ticker starts with rating and number of ratings. Then the number of ratings changes to show feedback on packaging, portion etc

Earlier ticker UI usage was limited to news channels and flight info at airports; places where you want to leverage the power of scrolling text info when screen estate is limited

I have not seen many apps use a ticker and it was surprising to discover it on Swiggy

You can also tap and access feedback around portion size, taste etc


### Pending orders on Google Pay

Google Pay seriously needs a card called 'ongoing order' at the top of its home screen

If you initiate a payment using UPI on some merchant platform you have to wait till you get the UPI pay notification which takes you to the merchant screen inside Google Pay

The problem?

Notifications comes late. Sometimes it does not deep link properly to the correct screen

If your system knows there is a pending transaction just show it on the home screen. It is the most important JTBD when someone who has a ongoing/pending transaction opens Google Pay

This is hardly some original thought. This is what Amazon does on its homepage too

### New user experience on Apple products

Something Apple is still amazing at: first time user experience for a new product

Especially if you are an existing iPhone user

Setting up the new phone is almost like magic

Disclaimer: Not an iPhone user. But have heard multiple people gush about it
