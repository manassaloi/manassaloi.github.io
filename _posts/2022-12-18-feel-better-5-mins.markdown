Are you someone who sits at your desk for hours?

Then try this [stretching routine at your desk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAUf7aajBWE), followed by this [neck drill.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=K4dmZ5_n6uU) Your body will thank you.

You can also use the following mobility exercises from these apps:

- [Streching app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stretch-flexibility-at-home/id1412615103): I mostly do the knee routine from here as I hurt my knee playing football a few months back, and I am recovering currently.
- [Stretch Club](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1531580935#?platform=iphone): Everyday I do the posture reset exercise from here.
- [Nike Training Club](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nike-training-club-fitness/id301521403): 10-Min Yoga Posture Primer NTC.
