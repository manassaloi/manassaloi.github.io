"Oh, Deepseek is pushing their app instead of focusing on their web and API. It is a sneaky way to collect more user information." - X dot com.

There is a reason to push the app.

The most important design principle is: Out of sight, out of mind.

For example, I pay for both ChatGPT and Claude.

ChatGPT is a native Mac app. While Claude's desktop app is a very buggy Electron app that crashes and freezes frequently, so I use Claude only on the web and phone.

As a result, I almost never use Canvas (Artifacts) on ChatGPT because it is only available on the web version. The user experience is also poor. You have to select it, unlike Claude where it appears automatically in the right sidebar.

This shows why Claude has Projects even on the mobile app, even if people might not create projects on mobile. When you open the sidebar on the mobile app, you see Projects listed.

My ChatGPT usage is far higher, even though Sonnet is a better model for coding or writing because I work on my laptop. I just open ChatGPT more often because it is easily accessible in my Mac's dock.

The only place I use Sonnet more than the latest GPT models is in Cursor, where it is selected by default.

Likewise, I would probably even use Google's AI Studio more, but they don't have a native app.

Not everything is a conspiracy. Sometimes it is product management 101.

You need to reduce the time and steps to get value.
