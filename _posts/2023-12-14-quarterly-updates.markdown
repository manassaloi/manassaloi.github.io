title:  "Read quarterly updates"

Read investor letters and quarterly updates to become a better storyletter/ write better narratives when it comes to your team's charter and strategy. It is even more relevant for founders.

Learn how to write a narrative around where your business is today, what it has overcome, and why there is still so much upside.

Read Uber's entire investor day presentation from 2022. It is amazing.

You can to read through all past Constellation Software president's letters to understand how their investment philosophy has evolved over the years.

If you are too lazy to read entire quarterly updates, then you can check out these Twitter accounts for summaries:
- TheTranscript_
- ecommerceshares
- modestproposal1
- OddDiligence
- borrowed_ideas

Then read the entire update if it is relevant to you. I highly recommend all PMs to do this.
