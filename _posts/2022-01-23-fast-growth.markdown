title:  "Why join a late stage startup?"
---

One reason to join a fast growing late stage startup is that you get to see a good mix of scale + processes.

You will be headhunted after a couple of years at 2-3 levels higher than your current level, offered 50-100% pay bumps to just re run the same play books you learned.

If you don't believe me, just check the Linkedin of ex Gojek employees.
