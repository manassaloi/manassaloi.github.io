Every time I go on LinkedIn, I see posts which annoy me to no end. Sometimes it is by the same people.

I know that a lot people here might feel the same about me.

Hence I keep recommending people to unfollow me.

This is not me flexing. I have never understood following people, then rage commenting on his posts about something he posted.

I rarely comment on other people's posts. If I don't like someone, I block or mute him.

I don't come here for debates or discussions. This is the reason I have muted all notifications.

Twitter is a medium for me to share my thoughts. Most of them will be shit. Some might be useful to you.

Also, I tweet a lot.

So depending on noise vs signal, take a call! Thanks.
