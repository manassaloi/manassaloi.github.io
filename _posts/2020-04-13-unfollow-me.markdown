Every time I go on LinkedIn, I see posts which annoy me to no end. Sometimes it is by the same people

I know that a lot people here might feel the same about me

Hence I keep recommending people to unfollow me

![Unfollow me](/assets/img/unfollow_me.png)

This is not me flexing. I have never understood following people, then rage commenting on his posts about something he posted

I rarely comment on other people's posts. If I don't like someone, I block or mute him

I don't come here for debates or discussions. This is the reason I have muted all notifications

This is just a way for me to share my thoughts. Most of them will be shit. Some might be useful to you

So depending on noise vs signal, take a call! Thanks
