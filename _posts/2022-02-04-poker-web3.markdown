title:  "Poker and Web3"
---

A few years back [I got obsessed with Poker](https://manassaloi.com/2020/04/07/learning-poker.html), and spent all my post work hours watching Twitch streams of players. Read like a dozen books. And yes, played every day till early morning.

I have the same interest in crypto today. All I do is watch [crypto content](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPrfSKMBov8) and read newsletters.

Crypto is like a game at this point. Like what Poker was. I can't stop thinking about it. Trying to figure it out.

I will be honest, the only reason I am not as involved in this space is because I am scared of regulatory uncertanties.

If I was in Singapore/Dubai, I would have invested a lot more. Maybe even joined a web3 startup.

For example, I know I can use a VPN and play Poker, even though my state government has banned it. But I don't do that. I don't want to add complexity in my life.

Confession: I have not made much money from crypto. My holding is pretty small. I don't even check my Binance account. I will never shill Laxmi NFTs to you.

So don't worry.
