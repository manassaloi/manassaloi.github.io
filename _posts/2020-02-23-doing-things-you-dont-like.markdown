title: "Doing things you don't like"

**If you have to do a task you don't like, couple it with a rewarding activity**

Example. I hate walking home after office. So I rewarded myself excellent [noise cancellation headphones](https://www.sony.co.in/electronics/headband-headphones/wh-1000xm3) to listen to podcasts while walking. Now it is very easy for me to choose walking over ordering an Uber

Note: People talk about how they reward themselves post workout with their favourite food. Just want to point out the difference between my approach and that: In the post workout gym meal situation, the reward is a delayed gratification. Most humans want instant gratification. And hence I think my approach is superior
