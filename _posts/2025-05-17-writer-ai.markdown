title:  "Writer AI over ChatGPT?"
---

Enterprises are adopting Writer AI for several key reasons, particularly when comparing it to general tools like ChatGPT for content creation:

* Data Privacy and Security: Unlike public tools, Writer is designed with enterprise data security and confidentiality in mind. One source explicitly states that they are "not going to be uploading like recaps of recordings or transcripts into ChatGPT, but we can definitely do that in Writer". This is because everything uploaded into Writer is allowed and the information can be retrieved, whereas ChatGPT typically uses publicly available information. Another source highlights that they found Writer natively passed their network and security protocols, which other tools (like Grammarly, which explicitly stated they would scrape every screen they see) did not. This focus on privacy means that a company's intellectual property and sensitive data remain theirs when using Writer.
* Ability to Use Internal Data and Knowledge: Writer allows enterprises to leverage their own internal data by setting up knowledge graphs that can be used as a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) model. These knowledge graphs can be updated dynamically or through regular polling of internal systems like Slack or internal websites. This enables users to ask questions about their own data or internal developments. This capability is crucial for tasks like internal research, understanding what has been tested or piloted within the company, or asking about product features and release dates using internal postings. This is a significant advantage over tools like ChatGPT which typically rely on publicly available information.
* Brand Voice, Style Guide Enforcement, and Consistency: A fundamental use case for Writer is ensuring consistent voice and tone across content, aligning with the company's style guide. For large organisations with thousands of employees involved in writing, teaching everyone to sound like the company is impossible. Writer's style guide controls and plug-ins provide tools at the point of need to help achieve this consistency. Implementing style guides and terminology in Writer is a significant amount of work upfront, but crucial for maintaining brand standards across the enterprise.
* Enterprise Focus and Scalability: Writer is built from the start for the enterprise. This includes features like multiple style guides, robust implementation support, and enterprise-level security. While other tools (like Jasper) may have started with smaller clientele, Writer specifically targeted the enterprise market. This focus means Writer is designed to handle the complexity and scale of large organisations.
* Integration into Existing Workflows: Writer offers plug-ins and integrations for commonly used enterprise tools such as Figma, Chrome Documents, content management systems, Salesforce, internal databases, Outlook, desktop apps, and specific text fields within web pages like Jira tickets or WordPress. These integrations allow the AI tool to be "at the point of need" and "right there at their elbow" while users are in the middle of a task, providing suggestions and access to AI capabilities seamlessly. This makes it significantly more convenient and versatile than tools that might be separate web apps with clunkier interfaces.
* Beyond Basic Content Generation: While content creation is a shared use case, Writer is used for a variety of specific enterprise applications. This includes creating documentation for DevOps teams, generating content within design tools like Figma, training chatbots for employee guidance, supporting internal research using knowledge graphs, generating high-quality templatised briefs for external agencies, and even generating fully coded digital assets like HTML files using APIs. These applications often require integration with internal systems and adherence to specific brand and compliance guardrails.
* Cost-Effectiveness and ROI: Despite the challenge of funding the platform fee in some decentralised organisations, Writer is seen as cost-effective compared to hiring additional full-time employees or freelancers. One internal estimate showed a saving of approximately $1.5 million by using Writer compared to the time it would have taken employees to do the writing manually. The ROI is assessed by evaluating whether the tool compensates for scale or the need for a new hire. Although user costs may increase in the future as AI tools reach scale, the current cost per user is considered comparable to other business tools, with significantly more power.
* Enabling Non-Technical Users: Writer is described as putting a "very powerful and understandable tool" in the hands of non-technical people to learn and drive AI solutions for their teams. It aims to help non-technical users leverage and learn AI. The UI is intuitive and easy to use. They also offer resources like an AI studio with training to help users create their own apps.
Specific Enterprise Needs: Writer addresses specific enterprise needs that general tools may not, such as replacing tools like Grammarly which did not meet security and data handling requirements, handling complex style guide implementations, and managing user access via SSO.

In summary, while tools like ChatGPT are useful for general content creation, enterprises adopt Writer AI due to its enterprise-grade security and privacy features (particularly regarding internal data), its ability to ingest and utilise proprietary internal data via knowledge graphs, its focus on enforcing brand voice and style consistency across a large workforce, its deep integration into enterprise workflows and tools, and its application to a wider range of specific enterprise use cases beyond basic writing, often enabling non-technical users to leverage AI effectively and demonstrating clear cost savings.
