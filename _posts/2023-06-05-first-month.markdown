title:  "Your first month as a new PM matters"

Advice for PMs who are joining a new company: Your reputation as a PM will largely be made in the [first 90 days](https://manassaloi.com/2021/02/12/90-days.html). Maybe even 30 days, depending on the company.

Don't be invisible.
Build relationships.
[Bring energy](https://manassaloi.com/2020/03/15/energy-curator.html).

Most importantly, get your team some early wins. Ideally within the first month of joining.

This is the advice I give to every new person who joins my team. I also give it to new PMs who DM me asking for advice.

It may seem like obvious advice, but you'd be surprised how few people follow it.
