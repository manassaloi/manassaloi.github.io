title:  "Palantir for India"
---

I have tweeted about this many times in the past.
This is such a big opportunity that no one has nailed so far here.

Palantir won’t bother servicing companies in Southeast Asia. They remain focused on the West, mainly for cultural reasons and because of the larger deal sizes.

OpenAI, on the other hand, won’t send a full deployment engineering team unless the deal size is around $10 million (if I’m not mistaken). Most AI curious companies are just using these LLMs to chat, but have not got the most out of them.

People talk about building “Infosys 2.0,” but doing that requires more than just a team of smart techbros, you also need a founding team with the right connections to open doors.
(Take a look at the composition of the Brainco team for example from the transcript below.)

I heard rumors that a VC firm was seriously considering bringing together a group of AI experts from Silicon Valley to launch something similar in India. But people are underestimating how difficult it is to sell large-scale transformation projects.

You need both capability and access.

Infosys and the other WITCH companies can’t pull this off. They simply don’t have the muscle for it. This will have to come from a completely different company altogether.

"TBPN: You’ve been working with Jared Kushner on a new company. I know he’s been busy, but I’d love to hear the latest.

Elad Gil: Sure. We recently launched a company called Brainco, which focuses on using AI as a platform to help transform the world’s largest institutions. We’ve been working with a number of large enterprises, private equity firms, and others. It’s been a fun project to build alongside Jared, Eric Wu, and Luis Videgaray. Eric was the former CEO of Opendoor, and Luis served as the Finance and Foreign Minister of Mexico. It’s an interesting mix of people coming together to solve some of the biggest AI challenges.

TBPN: So was this born out of realizing how much firms like Accenture or McKinsey were charging to make “AI strategy” pitch decks—and thinking you could do it better by actually building software for these organizations?

Elad Gil: It’s definitely more focused on the software side. We’ve built a common platform that helps enterprises manage different forms of data, evaluation frameworks, and the other core systems they need to truly adopt AI. On top of that, we build vertical-specific applications—and sometimes horizontal ones—that can be reused across similar companies in the same industry.

For example, in financial services, there are a dozen things every major firm needs to build. There’s always some customization, but the core infrastructure remains the same. Think about large enterprise deals—if you’re Dell, VMware, or Oracle, and you’re doing a $50 million contract, you’ll absolutely tailor parts of it to the client. We’re similar in that way: a shared platform and vertical solutions, with client-specific customization where it matters.

TBPN: How are you thinking about your target customers? Are you focusing on certain verticals, like avoiding healthcare because of HIPAA, or defense because of FedRAMP? Or are you segmenting more by company size—say, only working with large enterprises, not mid-market firms?

Elad Gil: The goal is to work primarily with the world’s largest institutions—those with significant revenue, market cap, or impact. There will always be exceptions, but we’re focused on helping organizations that can use AI to create real leverage at massive scale.

TBPN: That makes sense. There was a report that JPMorgan is spending about $2 billion a year on AI to save roughly the same amount through automation.

Elad Gil: Exactly. They’re basically breaking even—though some of those savings are likely durable—but it shows how much value and investment is already being driven by enterprise AI adoption.
