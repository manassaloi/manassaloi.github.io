title: "What does a PM know anyway"

---
Recently wrote a thread on the PM role. Turning it into a blogpost (with some minor edits).

**/threadstarts**

- There is a joke that people who become PMs are not good at any particular thing and hence they get their MBAs and tell people what to do.

- TBH I became a PM because it was the only job where I could be good/amazing at multiple things.

**kind of a brag thread. ignore if you wish**

- I have heard this joke/comment so many times in my life from various ICs (devs/designer), that I have learned to not engage and just live with it.

- But I could have mentioned how I was one of the earliest members of Redbus' team in North East and single handedly doubled their partnerships in the 2 months I was interning with them.

- There was a time when I seriously considered Sales and Marketing as my full time career.

- I was a dev for 1.5 years where I did both front end (android for a few months) and then backend (node.js).

- I realised that instead of figuring out how to be one of the best devs in the world, I was reading posts on business strategy and design at night.

- So I moved to Product the first chance I got.

- I was following what Derek Sivers calls the ['no speed limit'](https://sivers.org/kimo).

- AND IT WAS EVERYTHING I IMAGINED IT TO BE.

- The first month I was figuring out how to launch a new BU inside coupondunia.

- Next 3 months I was sitting with devs, working on how we would build this product. I was not merely telling people what to do.

- I was reading documentation, figuring out how attribution worked, how to measure if the end customer actually ended up using our offers.

- I never liked going deep into micro details.

- Like how a code block should be structured, which design pattern to use etc never excited me.

- But thinking in terms of systems did.

- And I had the best 3 months ever figuring out how to build this new product.

- I learned marketing. I learned copywriting. I learned design. I did cold calls.

- I also did wireframes for an actual product for the first time.

- I built internal dashboards.

- It was amazing learning experience.

- I was doing more things not to hide my incompetence at a particular skill, but because I was actually good in multiple things.

- This realisation helped me fight this huge imposter syndrome I was suffering from, because I was managing a team for the first time and in some cases people almost double my age.

- But we did well. [The new business took off](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-we-scaled-cashboss-500k-downloads-5-months-manas-j-saloi/).

- I started not just reading but building better habits/models to learn more and incorporate the learnings in my day to day work
  - [Framework on how to learn](https://manassaloi.com/2019/03/08/how-to-learn.html)
  - [How to negotiate](https://manassaloi.com/2020/01/12/how-to-negotiate-job.html)
  - [How to make decisions](https://manassaloi.com/2019/02/23/how-to-make-big-decisions.html)
  - [Habits to improve productivity](https://manassaloi.com/2016/01/14/11-habits-change-life.html)

- As you can see I also have folders for everything I read and liked.

{% include webp-image.html img="bookmarks_folder_mj.png" alt="Bookmarks folder" %}

- Things I read for each job I held. And also each vertical inside Product Management.

- TBH one of my biggest fears was also driving me: What if the same joke that I wrote in the first tweet "PM ko aata kya hain" was true?

- I was obsessed with proving people wrong.

- I wanted to know more than my Designer, Dev, Data analyst, any IC I worked with.

- It was not just for ego. It was more than that.

- I know people think the job of a PM is the easiest.

- But try
  - convincing your TL about cutting scope of a project without understanding the underlying tech changes required.
  - debating with a designer about interaction on a button without understanding design yourself.

- Remember that no one reports to you. You have no explicit or implicit authority.

- But if they respect you then it is 90% of the job done.

- Relevant posts:
  - [Authority and Merit](https://medium.com/@jack/authority-merit-80ad140f990b).
  - [Influence over Authority](https://boz.com/articles/influence-over-authority).

- Finally this is the reason I read so much. And why with every passing year I want to be at least 10% better in some skill.

- Because I never wanted
  -  to be in a room with someone where they are thinking "sala PM hain to kuch bhi bolega/ PM will speak shit just because he can".
  -  to be the person who became a PM because he could not be good in anything.
