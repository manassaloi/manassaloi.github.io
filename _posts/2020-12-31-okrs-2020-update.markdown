My personal OKRs remain more or less the same throughout the year. You can compare these with the [OKRs I had set in January 2020.](https://manassaloi.com/2020/01/15/personal-OKRs-2020.html)

**Disclaimer:** Partially done is more of a red than green. I use various shades of yellow or red for that. But I had trouble changing cell colors on Google sheets for some reason. So it is not as green as it looks. I also did not add all the fuckups of 2020. You can do a more detailed review of 2020 and also plan for 2021 by following these resources: [How to Conduct an Annual Life Review That Will Catapult You into the New Year](https://schlaf.medium.com/how-to-conduct-an-annual-life-review-that-will-catapult-you-into-the-new-year-d5aaffebac1f), [How to Plan Your Ideal Year](https://medium.com/personal-growth/how-to-plan-your-ideal-year-2d12ff073467), [My new years resolution framework](https://www.shaanpuri.com/posts/my-new-years-resolution-framework) and [Annual review for 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=ERGbgvvCJ8o&feature=youtu.be).
