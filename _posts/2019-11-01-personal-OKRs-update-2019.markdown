title:  "Update on my 2019 personal OKRs"

---
I have been sharing my goals publicly for quite some time now

Some people feel that sharing your goals lead to a feeling of accomplishment and you drop the ball on them. I have had the opposite experience. Holding myself accountable publicly has always helped me stay focused and achieve my goals. Keeping that in mind I shared my personal OKRs on Twitter during the beginning of the year. The tweet got quite popular and a lot of people shared their OKRs with me and kept updating their own progress over time, example [this one by Nirant around Finance](https://twitter.com/NirantK/status/1189882367860707331)

Without further ado, here are the Objectives I set for myself this year and progress on each of the KRs

If you want to learn more about OKRs, here is a post which might help: [Summary of Measure What Matters](https://manassaloi.com/booksummaries/2016/03/02/measure-what-matters-doerr.html)

Next time someone asks for an OKR template I will just link them to this post :)
