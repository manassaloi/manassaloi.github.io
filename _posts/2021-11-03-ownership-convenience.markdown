title:  "Convenience over ownership fears"
---

- Ipod that holds 1000 songs (apple controlled) vs walkman cassettes (self owned)  
- Digital editions vs PS4 cds
- Dropbox vs external hard disks (with much more space)
- Coinbase (other centralised exchanges) vs hardware wallets/metamask
- Opensea vs decencralised NFT marketplaces

*I find this argument about users caring a lot about having control over their own data and hating centralised ownership flawed. Convenience wins over ownership fears almost always.*
