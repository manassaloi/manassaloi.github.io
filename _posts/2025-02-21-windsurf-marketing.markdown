title:  "Windsurf marketing"
---

Windsurf's influencer marketing makes a lot of sense when you understand the meta game behind it. It is important not just to hype up your product before your possible $3B fundraise, but it is also important to counter-position versus the biggest vibe coding tool currently valued at $2B, and thereby using this competitor as an anchor for pricing their next upcoming round. If you saw Friday email's recent video and how they were subtly counter-positioning versus Superhuman, you will understand the marketing efforts of these AI companies better. Working in Southeast Asia and seeing how Chinese founders operate has made me appreciate The Art of War a great deal, and it is lovely to see various tactics being deployed on our timeline.
