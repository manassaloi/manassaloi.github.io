title:  "Consumer founders = Pump dot fun creators?"
---

"I skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it has been." Pump dot fun. And the end game for software founders.

"I skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it has been." is a famous quote by Wayne Gretzky, one of the greatest ice hockey players of all time.

Gretzky was highlighting his ability to anticipate the movement of the game rather than just reacting to the current position of the puck. Instead of chasing the puck where it is at any given moment, he positioned himself ahead of time based on where it will be. This quote is widely used in business, technology, investing, and leadership to emphasize foresight and strategic thinking. It encourages people to predict future trends and position themselves accordingly, rather than focusing only on the present situation.

Bitcoin Mining & Proof of Work → Value from Computational Effort.

Early Bitcoin miners had to invest real world energy and computing power to generate new coins. There was proof of work in Bitcoin mining. Value was tied to computational effort.

Meme Coins & Pump dot projects → Value from Attention.

When creating tokens became trivial with cost approaching zero, the value shifted from computation to attention. Tokens stopped representing proof of work; they started representing hype.
Yes, there was a phase where proof of stake replaced proof of work, but it was transitory.
"I skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it has been." The end state was pump dot fun creators engaging in extreme antics to grab attention because attention = liquidity = price pump.

AI Generated Software → Zero Cost Code Creation.

AI is making it easier to generate software from simple prompts. If this trend continues, entire SaaS businesses could be spun up in minutes.
The competitive advantage won't be who can build the best product. It will be who can get people to care.
"I skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it has been." This means the logical conclusion will be that B2B founders will start behaving like pump dot fun memecoin creators, taking dumps in front of a camera to sell software products.
B2B Founders will be Attention Hackers.

If everyone can generate an AI SaaS instantly, traditional GTM strategies will collapse into pure attention hacking.

Instead of carefully planned sales cycles, we would see:
Outrage marketing where founders stir up controversy just to get noticed.
Stunts & viral antics like CEOs live streaming ridiculous challenges just to make their product go viral.
Meme first software launches where the brand/story matters more than the tech itself.

The best software won't be the most useful, or the one with product moat. It will be the most viral one.
There won't be any difference between B2B software CEOs and meme-token creators.
