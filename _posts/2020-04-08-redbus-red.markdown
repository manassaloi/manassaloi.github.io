title: "Why RedBus is Red"

---

I remember someone asking Phanindra Sama, founder of Redbus, why they named their product RedBus during a talk he was giving us at BITS. As far as remember, his reply was that names associated with color or number have a high recall factor. When I posted this on Twitter, someone shared this.

- Diner's black
- Shopper stop's citizen black card
- MMT Doubleblack
- Uber app (which started with black theme and everyone's personal driver as tagline)
