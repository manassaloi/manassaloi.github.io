title:  "Good writing = good thinking"
---

I was talking to a friend from Razorpay recently and he told me that a doc on API design by Shashank (founder of Razorpay) is one of the best technical docs he has seen in his career.

In another convo, Brijesh, who joined Fampay as Head of Product recently, mentioned that well written docs can be used as a proxy for founder quality.

Good writing = thinks well, communicates well, both key for long term success.

And it can also be used as a good tool to hire future employees.

I know that correlation is not causation and every good founder might not be a good writer. But if you write well as a founder, you can use memos to highlight your thinking ability.
