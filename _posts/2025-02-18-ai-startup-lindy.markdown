title:  "AI space volatility"
---

[An example](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/s/FdLwlCMUyL) of how volatile and competitive the AI space is. My last job was PMing a B2B SaaS product, and the biggest anxiety customers had was us shutting down. They used to say: "What if we move to your tool, become dependent by building workflows around your tool, and you shut down? It is better for us to rely on something Microsoft/Google provides." Slack also became stable over time. Yes, every customer is trying every AI tool available today. But soon they will start relying on the stable ones with traction.
