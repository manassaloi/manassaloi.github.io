title:  "What did you get done last week?"
---

All the PMs in my team have to submit a weekly slack update on Tuesday. The weekly update follows this format:

- Weekly updates for Team X
  - Link to doc for collated weekly updates [This helps stakeholders go through past updates]
  - Project 1 [Color code to mark status]
    - One line status about the project [something like Deployed on Integration last week]
    - Overall progress status [X% completed]
    - Total story points [X story points in total for the project]
    - Name of people working on the project [name everyone working in the project from designers to devs to QAs]
    - Completed last week
      - List of a few items done
    - Continuing this week
      - List of a few items to be picked up this week
    - Highlight blockers if any/ if delayed then explain why
- Other completed projects in the semester
- Projects deprioritised/ parked
- Tag relevant stakeholders for visibility

I love this format and would recommend everyone to use it.
