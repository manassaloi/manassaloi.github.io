title:  "Why have I not left India yet"
---

(This is the thread I wrote in November that got QT'ed by Balaji Srinivasan and later that got QT'ed by the Prime Minister of our country.)

Balaji is still India's biggest cheerleader who doesn't live in India.

If he lived here, he would have seen a woman with her baby girl electrocuted because she stepped on a live wire (imagine how many more people would have died if it had rained that day), goons stopping people late at night in Sarjapur, getting stuck in the traffic during the floods.

Got stuck every morning trying to get to work (maybe a global problem though). Heard about break-ins in Indiranagar.

All of this just this month.

I know of more people moving to the US from India than in, despite a weak US job market.

Here is what I told a friend yesterday, before people ask why I am still here.

I could have easily moved to, say, Singapore. This is why I did not:

I like being in India despite all the problems.
- All (or most) of my friends are here
- Deep in my heart I have a feeling that I will be lonely outside.
- (Apart from air quality, water and other issues) My quality of life is good. But if you are living in a rich (forgive me for calling myself that) techbro bubble, do not bubble, don't read the news too much, stay near the office, get a flat in a society with amenities, then you save a lot of time that you can use to do things you enjoy. Yeah, I live in a bubble.
- I don't like driving. So a move to the US is not an option. That leaves Europe or South-East Asia. They have good public transport or cheaper ride hailing. I can even get a driver here. But I don't go out much, so I've never needed one.
- I love being able to go out and have a idly sambhar whenever I want to. Idly sambhar after running in the morning tastes even better. Yes, you can say that you can get idly sambhar anywhere. Just as you can say that you can get good North Indian food in Bangalore. But let us just accept it: It is simply not the case.
- Also, my house in Singapore would have been as big as the room in my house here where I have my gym. And I would have paid five times more than I'm paying to rent it. I know this because many of my friends have moved to Singapore over recent years.
- I have access to all kinds of services here in India. And I save a lot of time.
- At this point in time, I would optimise on saving time more than anything else. And the fact that I can afford a maid, the services of Urban Company and Instamart on a daily basis is the best hack for me to be able to do all the things I want to do in life.

Of course, there are a lot more reasons. But I am going to stop here.

Deep down, I know that all these reasons are probably a result of my upbringing here and my unwillingness to move out of my comfort zone. If I wasn't born in India, let's say I was white and born in California: Would I have moved to Bangalore? Probably not.

I would not have cared so much about idly sambhar. My taste in food would have been very different. And I would be used to doing my own work. I wouldn't be dependent on cheap labour (just a fact). Maybe I would be more concerned about the quality of the air and the water and other things that people in the US take for granted.

One way to answer whether Bangalore is a global city that attracts the best talent is to ask a random white person working in Tech in Berlin and ask, given a choice: equivalent quality of life in the U.S./let's say New York vs. Bangalore, where would they move? We already know their response.
