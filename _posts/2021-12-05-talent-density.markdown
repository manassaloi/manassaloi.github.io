title:  "How to measure talent density"
---

Most companies think that they have high talent density and their team is full of A players. How do you measure this?

Here's how I think you can figure out your organisation's talent density:
- If you stack ranked your team, what would be the difference in the quality of work between your best performer vs the worst?
- How scared would you be to give your big bet P0 project to your worst member?

It does not matter if you are a seed stage or series Z startup, you should always aim for high talent density in your organisation. Avoid rent seekers, promote owners, and obsess on having a high performance bar. This is the only way for you to retain your A players.
