title:  "Throne ad"

I really like the idea of ThroneScience.

One of my favourite VC frameworks is: take what only the wealthy can get today and make it available to everyone.
But what if we could offer people something that was once fit only for royalty?

I wanted to play around with this idea.

Throne brands itself as the Whoop for your poop. Imagine Apple designing a toilet based health tracker.

The founder had shared their slide deck yesterday, so I tried out a few ad ideas.
The numbers are from their deck.

I tried 2 formats with slightly different copy and alignment. These exercises are part of my effort to improve my skills in design and marketing.
