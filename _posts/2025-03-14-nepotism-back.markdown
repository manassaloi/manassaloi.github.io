title:  "Nepotism will be back"
---

I am very bullish on nepotism making a comeback once AGI is here.

If AGI truly levels the playing field in terms of skill, anyone can perform coding tasks and delegate thinking to a model, then hiring decisions shift from "who's the most capable?" to "who do I trust the most?"

And trust, historically, defaults to family and close networks.

"Nepo capitalism" in an AGI world makes sense because, if execution is democratized, then access and control become the new power levers. Families will consolidate wealth by hiring within, knowing that any skill gaps can be filled by AI. Instead of Patel family motels in America, it will be Patel family SaaS empire, where every uncle and their cousin will be a "founder" while AGI does the heavy lifting.

(And there will be Leuva Patidar Samaj volleyball tournaments in Dallas, but this time not for motel or gas station owners in rural America, but SaaS business owners in SF. IWKYK.)
