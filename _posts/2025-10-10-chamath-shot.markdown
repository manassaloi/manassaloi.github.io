"There are about 150 people who run the world. Anybody who wants to go into politics, they’re all puppets. Okay? There are 150, and they’re all men, who run the world. Period. Full stop.

They control most of the important assets. They control the money flows. And these are not the tech entrepreneurs. Those guys are going to get rolled over in the next five to ten years by the people who are really underneath, pulling the strings.

When you get behind the curtain and see how that world works, you realize it’s unfairly set up for them and their progeny. I’m not saying that’s something we can rip apart, but the first order of business is: I want to break through and be at that table. That’s the first order of business.

The way I do that is by proving I can do what they do as well as they do it and then do it better. Because at the end of the day, they are commercial animals. And they’ll open the door out of curiosity, and they’ll let me stay because I add value. And once I’m there, I can open the door for other people who can try to do the same thing.

My entire goal now is to be in a position to aggregate enough of the world’s capital to then reallocate it according to my worldview. I’m not saying my worldview is the best or the right one, but it’s mine.

And at the end of the day, there are 150 other guys with their own worldviews, and they don’t care what you think about theirs. That’s the truth. So why not me? Why not one of you? Why not?"
