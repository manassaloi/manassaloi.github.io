title:  "So you want to learn Business Strategy?"

---

Strategy is mostly around creating competitive advantage/ moats/ secrets (what Thiel calls it). Here are a bunch of frameworks/books to think about the same

### Frameworks from some of my fav books on Strategy

1. **[Thiel’s 7 questions](https://manassaloi.com/booksummaries/2019/08/23/zero-one-peter-thiel.html)**: He explains how Tesla is different from other clean tech companies (check the end of the post). Zero to One is a must read if you work in startups/planning to startup.

2. **[Hamilton’s 7 powers:](https://manassaloi.com/booksummaries/2019/08/22/seven-powers-hamilton-helmer.html)** Scale economics, Network economics, Counter positioning, Switching cost, Branding, Cornered resources, Process power. Something you should read if you are interested in business strategy.

3. **[Munger’s 5 elements which create moats:](https://manassaloi.com/booksummaries/2016/03/07/charlier-munger-griffin.html)** Supply-Side Economies of Scale and Scope, Demand-Side Economies of Scale (Network Effects), Brand, Regulation, Patents and Intellectual Property.

4. **[Platform revolution](https://manassaloi.com/booksummaries/2016/03/21/platform-revolution-parker-choudary.html)** has a bunch of frameworks to think about how to build and grow a platform. It is highly relevant if you are working in a startup in the on demand space.

5. **[Blitzscaling](https://manassaloi.com/booksummaries/2016/03/29/blitzscaling-reid-hoffman.html)** is a good read if you want to understand how to build hyper growth business. It also has a lot of frameworks for growth: things which can turbocharge it or limit it.

6. **[Only the Paranoid Survive](https://manassaloi.com/booksummaries/2016/03/28/paranoids-survive-grove.html)** is a great playbook on surviving 10X changes and has lot of war stories from Intel.

7. **[Obviously Awesome](https://manassaloi.com/booksummaries/2017/07/09/obviously-awesome-april.html)** is one of the best books  on product positioning.

8. **[Blue Ocean Strategy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sx28G6cSbBjksvc0RoojQK4PiY1XgEPMHaenJvGRUWo/edit?usp=sharing)** is one of the first strategy books I ever read.

9. **[My fav one: Understanding Michael Porter](https://manassaloi.com/booksummaries/2017/07/17/understanding-porter-joan.html)** If you read this one you don't need to read another strategy book.

10. **[Competing Against Luck](https://manassaloi.com/booksummaries/2017/07/22/competing-against-luck-christensen.html)**:  Customers don’t buy products or services; they "hire" them to do a job.

11. **[Playing to Win - A.G. Lafley](https://manassaloi.com/booksummaries/2016/01/28/playing-win-lafley.html)**: Strategy is about making specific choices to win in the marketplace.

Honorary mentions: **Good to great**, **Built to last**, **Blue Ocean Strategy**, **The Innovator’s Dilemma**
I read them long back. Have to re read and take notes.
