**Note:** While reading a book whenever I come across something interesting, I highlight it on my Kindle. Later I turn those highlights into a blogpost. It is not a complete summary of the book. These are my notes which I intend to go back to later. Let's start!

### Poker Maths

+ Mathematical expectation is the amount a bet will average
winning or losing

+ Let's say you are betting a friend $1, even money, on the flip
of a coin. Each time it comes up heads, you win; each time it
comes up tails, you lose. The odds of its coming up heads are 1to-1, and you're betting $1-to-$1. Therefore, your mathematical
expectation is precisely zero since you cannot expect,
mathematically, to be either ahead or behind after two flips or
after 200 flips.Your hourly rate is also zero. Hourly rate is the amount of
money you expect to win per hour.

+ You have the best of it when you have a positive expectation,
and you have a positive expectation when the odds are in your
favor. You have the worst of it when you have a negative
expectation, and you have a negative expectation when the odds
are against you. Serious gamblers bet only when they have the
best of it; when they have the worst of it, they pass

+ A person writes down a number from one to five and
bets $5 against your $1 that you cannot guess the number. Should
you take the bet? What is your mathematical expectation?Four guesses will be wrong, and one will be right, on
average. Therefore, the odds against your guessing correctly are 4-to-1. Chances are that in a single try you will lose the dollar.
However, you are getting $5-to-$1 on a 4-to-1 proposition. So the
odds are in your favor, you have the best of it, and you should
take the bet. If you make that bet five times, on average you will
lose $1 four times and win $5 once. You have earned $1 on five
bets for a positive expectation of 20 cents per bet

+ A bettor is taking the odds when he stands to win more than
he bets, as in the example above. He is laying the odds when he
stands to win less than he bets. A bettor may have either a positive
or a negative expectation, whether he is taking the odds or laying
them. If you lay $50 to win $10 when you are only a 4-to-1
favorite, you have a negative expectation of $2 per bet, since
you'll win $10 four times but lose $50 once, on average, for a net
loss of $10 after five bets. On the other hand, if you lay $30 to win
$10 when you're a 4-to-1 favorite, you have a positive expectation
of $2, since you'll win $10 four times again but lose only $30
once, for a net profit of $10. Expectation shows that the first bet
is a bad one and the second bet is a good one

+ Poker plays can also be analyzed in terms of expectation.
You may think that a particular play is profitable, but sometimes
it may not be the best play because an alternative play is more
profitable. Let's say you have a full house in five-card draw. A
player ahead of you bets. You know that if you raise, that player
will call. So raising appears to be the best play. However, when
you raise, the two players behind you will surely fold. On the
other hand, if you call the first bettor, you feel fairly confident
that the two players behind you will also call. By raising, you gain
one unit, but by only calling you gain two. Therefore, calling has
the higher positive expectation and is the better play

+ When you
go into a poker game, you should try to assess what you think you
can earn per hour. If you are playing
draw lowball and you see three players calling $10 and then
drawing two cards, which is a very bad play, you can say to
yourself that each time they put in $10 they are losing an average
of about $2. They are each doing it eight times an hour, which
means those three players figure to lose about $48 an hour. You
are one of four other players who are approximately equal, and
therefore you four players figure to split up that $48 an hour,
which gives you $12 an hour apiece. Your hourly rate in this
instance is simply your share of the total hourly loss of the three
bad players in the game

+ You
should almost always try to make the play that will maximize your positive expectation or minimize your negative expectation
in order to maximize your hourly rate

+ You should try to assess most poker games in terms of your
expected hourly rate by noticing what mistakes your opponents
are making and how much these mistakes are costing them. Don't
sit in a game with an insufficient hourly rate projection unless you
think the game will become better either because you expect
some weaker players to arrive soon or because some good players
in the game have a tendency to start playing badly when they are
losing. If these good players jump off winners, you should quit if
you can

### Fundamental Theorem of Poker

+ Every time you play a hand differently from the way
you would have played it if you could see all your
opponents' cards, they gain; and every time you play
your hand the same way you would have played it if
you could see all their cards, they lose. Conversely,
every time opponents play their hands differently
from the way they would have if they could see all
your cards, you gain; and every time they play their hands the same way they would have played if they
could see all your cards, you lose.

+ Suppose there is $80 in the pot, and you have two pair. You
are playing draw poker, and you bet $10, which we will assume
is all you can bet. Your single opponent has a fourflush that is,
four cards to a flush. The question is are you rooting for him to
call or fold? Naturally you want him to do what is most profitable
for you. The Fundamental Theorem of Poker states that what is
most profitable for you is for your opponent to make the incorrect
play based on complete information about both hands. Since your
opponent is getting 9-to-1 odds (his $10 call might win him $90)
and is only about a 5-to-1 underdog to make a flush, it is correct
for him to call because a call has positive expectation. Since it is
correct for him to call, following the Fundamental Theorem, you
are therefore rooting for him to fold

+ Just as you are rooting for an opponent to fold when he is
getting sufficient pot odds, you are rooting for him to call when
he is getting insufficient pot odds. Thus, it is frequently correct to
play a strong hand weakly on an early round the converse of
your plays in the previous two examples - so that your opponent
will make a bad call when you do improve

+ When you have a hand that is rooting for a call, you should
not try to make your opponent fold by betting an exorbitant
amount in a no-limit or pot-limit game

+ In advanced poker you are constantly trying to make your
opponent or opponents play in a way that would be incorrect if
they knew what you had. Anytime they play in the right way on
the basis of what you have, you have not gained a thing.
According to the Fundamental Theorem of Poker, you play
winning poker by playing as closely as possible to the way you
would play if you could see all your opponents' cards; and you try
to make your opponents play as far away from this Utopian level
as possible. The first goal is accomplished mainly by reading
hands and players accurately, because the closer you can come to
figuring out someone else's hand, the fewer Fundamental
Theorem mistakes you will make. The second goal is
accomplished by playing deceptively

### Ante and Odds

+ The lower the ante in
comparison to future bets, the fewer hands you should play; the
higher the ante, the more hands you should play. A different way
of looking at it is: The lower the ante, the higher your starting
requirements should be, and the higher the ante, the lower your
starting requirements should be

+ It
is a common fallacy for players to think in terms of the money
they have already put in the pot. They make a bad call because
they called one or two bets on earlier rounds. However, it is
absolutely irrelevant whether you put the money in there or someone else did. It is the total amount, no part of which belongs
to you any longer, that should determine how you play your hand

+ The size of the ante in a particular game determines how you
play. The larger the ante in comparison to later bets, the more
hands you should play. Since there's more money in the pot,
you're obviously getting better odds, but there are other reasons
for playing more loosely. Should you wait to get an extremely
good hand in a high ante game, you'll have lost more than the size
of the pot in antes by the time you win a pot. Furthermore, the
pots you do win will be comparatively small because the other
players, if they are decent players, will notice you are playing
very tight and won't give you much action when you do play a
hand. In fact, when you do get action, you're very likely to be
beat

+ If it makes sense to try to win antes right away when they are large, it makes abundant sense not to slowplay a good hand.'   The reason is that if you don't raise with a good hand on the first round, you are giving an opponent with a mediocre hand the
chance to come in cheaply and possibly draw out on you. With a
large ante, he is not making a mistake on the basis of the
Fundamental Theorem of Poker because he is getting good odds.
In other words, if a player is getting 8-to-1 odds or 10-to-1 odds
on that first round, it is worth it for him to come in and hope to
catch a perfect card on the next round even when he is pretty
sure you are slowplaying a big hand. However, when you raise,
you wreck the odds he is getting, and he has to throw away his
mediocre hand. With almost any good hand, it is not worth letting
opponents in cheaply when the ante gets up there. You are
satisfied with winning only the antes. On the other hand, when the
ante is low, it becomes more reasonable to slowplay big hands in
order to suck worse hands in; you want to get more value for your
big hands

+ Pot odds are the odds the pot is giving you for calling a bet.
If there is $50 in the pot and the final bet was $10, you are getting
5-to-1 odds for your call. If there is $50 in the pot and the final bet was $10, you are getting
5-to-1 odds for your call. It is essential to know pot odds to figure
out expectation. In the example just given, if you figure your
chances of winning are better than 5-to-1, then it is correct to call.
If you think your chances are worse than 5-to-1, you should fold

+ The ability to fold correctly when you suspect you are
drawing dead or drawing with too little chance of ending up with
the best hand is one attribute that distinguishes a good player from
an average one

+ When all the cards are out, your hand is worth a call if you think
your chances of winning are better than your pot odds. Before the
draw in draw poker and with exactly one card to come in stud
games, your decision to call with a hand that needs to improve
depends upon these factors:

  + Your chances of improving, taking into account the needed
cards already out against you (in stud) and any extra outs you
might have
  + Your chances of winning if you do improve
  +  The odds you are getting on this next-to-last round of betting,
taking into account the possibility of a raise behind you if
you are not the last to act.
  +  Your expected extra profits on the last round of betting if you
do make your hand.This last factor is what I call implied odds. It is the money
you expect to win by betting or raising on the last round (or
rounds) when you do make your hand

+ When you compute odds on a hand you intend to play to the end, you must think not in terms of the immediate pot odds but in terms of the total amount you might lose versus the total amount you might win

+ Before deciding to go all the way with a
hand, you must calculate whether the effective odds you are
getting by calling several rounds of betting justify a call now

+ Figuring effective odds may sound complicated, but it is a
simple matter of addition. You add all the calls you will have to
make, assuming you play to the end, to determine the total amount
you will lose if you don't make your hand. Then compare this
figure to the total amount you should win if you do make the
hand. This total is the money in the pot at the moment plus all
future bets you can expect to win, excluding your own future bets.
Thus, if there is $100 in the pot at the moment and three more $20
betting rounds, you are getting $160-to-$60 effective odds if both
you and your opponent figure to call all bets. If you know you
won't call on the end unless you make your hand, your effective
odds become $160-to-$40. When you think your opponent won't
call on the end if your card hits, your effective odds would be
reduced to something like $140-to-$40. If, on early betting
rounds, these odds are greater than your chances of making your
hand, you are correct to see the hand through to the end. If they
are not, you should fold

+ During the early and middle rounds of betting, having to call
future bets usually reduces your apparent pot odds considerably,
and you have to calculate your real or effective odds. However,
there are times when the existence of future bets is the very reason
you play a hand. Your immediate pot odds may not seem high
enough to justify calling for one more card. But if that card may
give you a monster hand that figures to get you a lot of action, you
frequently don't need the initial odds from the pot. You'll get
them later. These odds are what I mean by implied odds

+ Implied odds are based on the possibility of winning money
in later betting rounds over and above what is in the pot already.
More precisely, your implied odds are the ratio of your total
expected win when your card hits to the present cost of calling a
bet

+ In general, the larger the difference between future bets and
the present bet you have to call, the greater your implied odds.
Hence, implied odds become most significant in pot-limit games
and in no-limit games, where a future bet can be as large as the
amount of money a player has in front of him. In fact, in these
games one is almost always considering not how much is in the
pot right now, but rather how much can be won on a future round
of betting

+ When you estimate your implied odds, you must try to
predict how much money you can win if you do make your hand.
This prediction depends on three factors:
  + The size of future bets
  + How hidden your hand is
  + The ability of your opponents

+ Implied odds explain situations when your odds are better
than they seem. There are other times when you must realize that
your odds are not as good as they seem. These situations occur
when you have a mediocre hand with little chance of improving,
which you think is the best hand at the moment, yet your
opponent keeps betting. You think he may be bluffing, and you
can beat only a bluff - that is, a hand that is weaker than what
your opponent is representing. However, since your opponent is
controlling the betting, he will probably back off on later rounds
if he doesn't have you beat. Thus, you are in the position of
winning the minimum if you have the best hand but losing the
maximum if you have the worst hand. The true pot odds in such
situations are much worse than they seem, and so we call them
reverse implied odds.For instance, there is $50 in the pot, and your opponent bets
$20. You think you have him beat, but you are not sure. You also
have little chance of improving. You cannot say, "I'm getting 70to-20 odds here," because your opponent may come out betting again next round if he has a better hand than yours - or if his
hand improves to a better hand but he is likely to give it up if
he has a worse hand than yours. You are in a situation where, if
you lose, you figure to lose not just the $20 you are calling right
now but a total of $60. However, if you win, you'll probably win
only the $70 in the pot right now because once your opponent sees
you're committed to the pot, he won't bet, further with the worst
hand. All of a sudden, then, you're not getting 70-to-20 odds but
closer to 70-to-60.

+ Reverse implied odds describe situations in which:
  + You're not sure where you're at
  + You have little chance of improving to beat the hand your
opponent might already have or might make
  + A call commits you to calling future bets all the way to the
end
  + Your opponent can back off at any time.In such cases, you must not think you are getting odds according
to what's in the pot and what you have to call right now. You are
getting much worse odds - so much worse that it is often better to throw your hand away immediately rather than get committed.

+ Whereas implied odds are based on the possibility of winning
more money in later betting rounds, reverse implied odds are
based on the possibility of losing more money in later betting
rounds. Put another way, when you're getting implied odds,
you're glad you're not all-in, for you expect to make money on
future bets if your card hits. However, when you're getting
reverse implied odds, you wish you were all-in so you could see
the hand to the end without having to call future bets

### Disguising hands

+ With weak players, with a large pot, and with large early
bets, you need not be so concerned about disguising your hand. A
corollary is that the more players in the pot, the less you gain by
disguising your hand. You cost yourself too much when you do.
You won't be able to make everybody fold when you bet with a
weak hand, and you cost yourself too many bets when you miss
a raise with a strong hand. What's more, when you let many
opponents in cheaply, you increase the chances of being
outdrawn. Heads-up situations require disguising your hand more
than do multi-way pots

+ Let's look at two early-round betting situations - one in
which you don't care that you've given your hand away and the
other in which you should use deception. In both situations you have a pair of aces in the hole before the flop in hold 'em. That is,
you have the nuts, the best possible hand at that point.
The first game is no-limit. You've made a small raise, four or
five people have called, and now someone puts in a substantial
reraise. You must reraise again even if your play gives away your
hand completely. It is worth dropping all disguise because as the
pot gets larger and larger, what's in the pot right now counts more
than potential bets on later rounds. With two aces you should put
in all the bets you can.On the other hand, with two aces against a good player in a
limit hold 'em game, you should often not put in all bets. A
reraise is fine because you could have a variety of hands.
However, if your single opponent reraises again, you should
probably just call. If you raise one more time, your opponent
figures you for two aces. All you have gained is one small extra
bet right there, but you may have cost yourself two or three bets
later on. In this case, you have lost too much by giving your hand
away. You stand to gain more by using deception

+ The general rule is: The better the players and the smaller the
pot, the more you disguise your hand when there are more cards
to come. The worse the players and the larger the pot, the more
you play your hand normally, without regard to giving anything
away. Sometimes, though, playing your hand normally may be the
best deception of all against very tough players who expect you to
be deceptive

+ It is extremely important to disguise your hand against
players who put great emphasis on reading hands, though such
players may not necessarily be good, and when deceptive play has
gotten the super readers confused, they've got no chance. This
type tends to put you on a hand early, and like a captain going
down with the ship, he sticks to his opinion until the end.

+ There are five criteria for using deception to avoid giving
your hand away:

  +  You are up against good players or super readers
  +  The pot is small in comparison to future bets
  + The present round of betting is small in comparison to future
bets.
  +  You have only one or two opponents against you
  + You are slowplaying a monster hand.The first two conditions are most significant. It is not
necessary to meet all five conditions before deception is
employed. Three of the five are usually sufficient so long as one
or both of the first two are included.Do not use deception against bad players, against many
players, when the pot is large, or when the early bets are large. It
is especially important to play a good hand strongly if the pot is
large. The only exception would be when you have an unbeatable hand and figure you will gain more by waiting a round before
making your move.

+ The basis of your decision to play normally or deceptively is
simple. You should play each session and each hand of each
session in the way that will win the most money and lose the least
(except when you intentionally play a hand badly to create an
impression for future hands). Always remember from the
Fundamental Theorem of Poker that the more your opponents
know about your hand, the less likely they are to make mistakes.
However, there are situations when deception can be costly and
straightforward play is best

+ When the pot is big, you want to win it right away. To try to win
it right away, you should bet and raise as much as possible,
hoping to drive everybody out, but at least reducing the
opposition. You should bet and raise with the best hand, and you
should frequently do the same even with a hand you think maybe
second best. The fewer opponents you have in a pot, the greater
your chances of winning it, even if those chances are less than 50
percent; and when the pot gets large, winning it should be your
foremost concern

### Free cards and Betting

+ When you have the best hand, you do not want to
give opponents a free card since you are giving them a chance to
outdraw you and win the pot. By the same token, when you do not
have the best hand, you want to try to get a free card to get a free
shot at winning the pot

+ Giving a free card means checking a hand you could have bet
when there are more cards to come. Of course, when you check
with the intention of raising, you are giving a free card only when
your opponent is so uncooperative as not to bet into you

+ It is almost never correct to
give a free card when the pot is large

+ It turns out that it is rarely
correct to give a free card with medium-sized pots, even when you
know your opponent will fold if you bet. You simply have to be
satisfied with what there is in the pot already. One reason you
should bet is that generally you want your opponent to fold

+ When you have a chance to bet and you have a decent hand,
especially a hand you think is the best one, it is almost always
correct to bet. The only conditions that might make it incorrect to
bet are the following:
  + The pot is small in comparison to what it might be in the
future and you figure to gain more in future bets through
deception than by giving your hand away now; this situation
occurs most often in pot-limit and no-limit games
  +  You think you can get in a check-raise.3. Your hand is so strong it's worth giving a free card even with
a medium-sized pot

+ When you're trying to decide whether or not to bet your hand
and worry about making a mistake, you should keep in mind one
very important principle a mistake that costs you the pot is a
catastrophe, especially if the pot has become relatively large,
while a mistake that costs you one bet is not. When in doubt,
make sure you don't make a mistake that costs you the pot.
Checking and giving an opponent with a worse hand a free card
may cost you the pot when he outdraws you. However, betting
and getting called by a better hand costs you at most just that one
bet. Thus, the only time to give free cards with the probable best
hand is when your hand is so strong it is in little danger of being
outdrawn and your deception sets up the likelihood of larger
profits in future bets in comparison to what is currently in the pot

### Semi bluff

+ A semi-bluff is a bet
with a hand which, if called, does not figure to be the best hand at
the moment but has a reasonable chance of outdrawing those
hands that initially called it

+ When you bet as a semi-bluff, you are
rooting to win right there just as you are when you make a pure
bluff. However, in contrast to a pure bluff, you still retain a
chance of outdrawing your opponent if you are called. Even when
you bet with a legitimate hand, you are generally rooting to win
instantly, but when you semi-bluff, you especially want your
opponents to fold because one of them may be folding the best
hand

+ Betting is particularly important when you're in first position, in
which case you should apply the following rule: If your hand is
worth a call or almost worth a call when someone else bets, it is
better to bet yourself, especially when you have little fear of a
raise and when there is some chance you will win right there by
making your opponent fold

+ Both the semi-bluff and betting a marginal hand rather than
risking giving a worse hand a free card are cases of the general
precept that it is usually better to be betting than calling. By
betting as a semi-bluff you have a chance of winning the pot right there, something you are usually hoping to do, and you have
shown greater strength than you really have. If you catch
scary-looking cards after you have been called, you are still likely
to win pots you wouldn't otherwise have won. When you bet now,
your opponent is quite likely to fold. On the other hand, when you
don't improve and are caught in a semi-bluff, that can be of value
as an advertisement for the future

+  A semi-bluff is a bet, raise, or check-raise with a wide variety
of hands which you believe are not the best at the moment.
However, they may win not only right there when your
opponent folds but also in a showdown when they improve
to the best hand. They may also win when your opponent
folds on a later round after you catch a scare card that makes
your hand look like the best hand

+  A semi-bluff may be used in any game, but it may be used
only with more cards to come

+  Sometimes a hand with which you think you are
semi-bluffing is in fact the best hand. By betting, you prevent
a worse hand from getting a free card

+  If you have a hand that warrants a call when your opponent
bets, it is usually correct to bet yourself, particularly in first
position. You thereby gain the chance of winning the pot
immediately, and you show more strength than you actually
have, which can be to your advantage later

+  Semi-bluffs allow you to be the bettor instead of the caller,
which nearly always puts you in a more advantageous
position

+  Semi-bluffs are a good way to randomize your bluffs, for you
have the added equity of a possible win even when you are
called

+  A semi-bluff can frequently be a profitable play in situations
where a pure bluff is not. Your extra out of outdrawing your
opponent can swing your mathematical expectation from the
minus to the plus side

+  You usually do not semi-bluff when you are sure your
opponent will call. However, if there is a possibility that opponent will fold, you should bet - or raise with a
semi-bluffing hand, especially as the pot gets larger

+  It is usually better to make a semi-bluff bet when you are first
to act; when you are last, you have the opportunity of giving
yourself a free card, and you may not want to risk the chance
of an opponent check-raising you

+ While calling may be a good defense against the semi-bluff
in some situations, remember that
normally the correct play is to fold with marginal hands, and if
folding isn't correct, then you should raise. When someone bets or raises but may be semi-bluffing, your
decision is one of the trickiest in poker. You must choose whether
to fold; raise; reraise; call and bet on the next round; call and
check-raise on the next round; call and then check and call on the
next round; or call and fold on the next round if the card your
opponent catches would make the hand with which he might have
been semi-bluffing. Making the correct decision consistently
separates the true champion from the merely good player

+ Principal reasons for raising:
  + To get more money in the pot when you have the best hand
  + To drive out opponents when you have the best hand
  + To bluff or semi-bluff
  + To get a free card
  + To gain information
  + To drive out worse hands when your own hand may be
second best
  + To drive out better hands when a come hand bets

+ Raising as a pure bluff with a hand that has no chance of
winning if called is a tricky play, too risky to be attempted often.
It is usually done only when there are no more cards to come,
often when you didn't make the hand you were hoping to make
but are trying to convince your opponent you did. Presumably
your opponent has a decent hand to bet into you and is reluctant
to throw it away when you raise. In limit poker, raising as a pure
bluff can succeed often enough to be profitable only against a
very tough player who is capable of making super-tough folds.
The weaker the player, the more likely he is to call your raise with
any kind of hand

+ Raising is often a better alternative than folding, with calling
the worst of the three

### Slowplaying

+ Check-raising and slowplaying are two ways of playing a
strong hand weakly to trap your opponents and win more money
from them. However, they are not identical. Check-raising is
checking your hand with the intention of raising on the same
round after an opponent bets. Slowplaying is playing your hand in a way that
gives your opponents no idea of its strength. It may be checking
and then just calling an opponent who bets, or it may be calling a
person who bets ahead of you. When you slowplay a hand, you
are using deception to keep people in for a while in order to make
your move in a later round. Clearly, then, a hand you slowplay has
to be much stronger than a hand with which you check-raise.
Check-raising can drive opponents out and may even win the pot
right there, while slowplaying gives opponents either a free card
or a relatively cheap card

+ The way you bet or check-raise depends on the strength of your hand in relation to what you can see of the other hands and the position of the player you expect to bet or raise behind you when you check or bet

+ While you generally check-raise because you think you have
the best hand, it is frequently correct to check-raise with a
second-best hand if the play will drive other opponents out

+ When you check-raise you usually want to reduce the number
of your opponents, but when you slowplay you are trying to keep
as many players in the pot as you can, expecting to collect later
bets from them as a result of your early deception. Obviously,
since you are not worried about having many players in the pot
and are not particularly concerned about giving them free cards,
you must have a very strong hand to slowplay much stronger
than a hand with which you would check-raise

+ For a slowplay to be correct, all of the
following must be true:
  + You must have a very strong hand
  + The free card or cheap card you are allowing other players to
get must have good possibilities of making them a
second-best hand
  + That same free card must have little chance of making
someone a better hand than yours or even giving that person
a draw to a better hand than yours on the next round with
sufficient odds to justify a call
  + You must be sure you will drive other players out by showing
aggression, but you have a good chance of winning a big pot
if you don't
  + The pot must not yet be very large

### Type of Poker players

+ Loose poker players play a large percentage of hands. They
have relatively low starting requirements, and they continue in the
pot with relatively weak hands. Tight players play a small
percentage of hands. Their starting requirements are high, and
they are quick to throw away weak hands that don't develop into
big hands. Some players always play loose. Others always play
tight. Good players adjust their play to the game

+ You can
steal antes with anything (a loose play) much more successfully
against tight players, who will fold their marginal hands, than you
can against loose players, who are likely to call you with those
same hands. However, the principle of playing loose against tight
players and tight against loose players is in need of refinement

+ With respect to semi-bluffing,
you must play much tighter in a loose game as opponents play loose and tend to call instead of folding

+ In a loose game people are
willing to play a hand that is relatively lower in value than the
average. Therefore, your own legitimate hands don't need to be
quite as good as in a normal game since your opponents are likely
to be staying with you with even worse hands. This becomes
especially true when you get heads-up against one opponent.However, because of the action and the participants' style of
play, loose games frequently tend to have multi-way pots. With
many players staying in, you would be wrong to loosen up with
hands like two small pair or one medium pair. Even though these marginal hands might be favorites to hold up against each of several loose opponents individually, chances are they will lose when there are several opponents in the pot. By the same token, if you bet with these hands, you are much less likely to get two, three, or four opponents to fold, particularly when they are loose players, than you are to get one opponent to fold

+ In loose games, you should tighten up considerably on semi-bluffs but loosen up with legitimate hands. However, you would not play loose with marginal hands like two small pair or one medium pair when several opponents are in the pot

+ In a tight game semi-bluffs increase in value, and even pure bluffs can be profitable since tight players are more likely to fold. Paradoxically, though, legitimate hands don't have nearly the value in a tight game that they would have in an average or loose game. The reason should be obvious. When you bet a legitimate hand for value in a tight game, you will be called only by players who have strong hands themselves because tight players' starting requirements are higher. In a loose game an opponent with two
small pair at the end will probably call your bet with aces up. But
when you bet that same hand in a tight game - especially if both
of your aces are showing - and you get called, you cannot feel
too comfortable. The caller probably has you beat

+ In a tight game the value of
a hand goes down because players who stay in the pot will have
good hands themselves better hands on average than players in
a regular game would have.In a tight game, then, you loosen up on bluffs and
semi-bluffs, but you tighten up on your legitimate hands. Nor
would you play as many drawing hands in a tight game, since
you'd be getting pot odds sufficient to make it worthwhile less
often, and when you did hit, you wouldn't get paid off as much as
you would in an average or in a loose game

+ To use all the poker tools at your disposal, you need to adjust
your play according to the game and according to the individual
players in the game

+ Never forget that in poker we are trying to win
money, not pots. Every decent player wins a fair share of pots, but
it is the extra bets you can get into the pots you win and those you
can save from the pots you lose that increase your hourly rate and
the money won in the long run

+ In a horse race you like being first, in a poker
game you like being last

### Position and pure bluffing

+ Position is important in relation to the playing style of the
other players in the game. You prefer having the loose, aggressive
player in the game sitting to your right and the tight, conservative
player to your left. Then you can usually decide how to play your
hand after the aggressive player has acted, while you don't have
to worry about many surprises from the conservative player
behind you. You are also in a better position to control the
aggressive player and indeed to trap him into mistakes. Similarly,
if there are players in the game who tip off whether or not they are
playing a hand, you'd like them to your left so you can use that
information when deciding whether to call the first bet yourself

+ A person who bluffs with
approximately the right frequency - and also, of course, in a
random way - is a much better poker player and will win much
more money in the long run than a person who virtually never
bluffs or a person who bluffs too much. The person who never
bluffs will never get much action. The person who always bluffs
will get all the action he wants until he runs out of money. But the
person who bluffs correctly keeps his true holdings disguised and
is constantly forcing his opponents into tough decisions, some of
which are bound to be wrong

+ What is the right bluffing frequency? It is a frequency that
makes it impossible for your opponents to know whether to call
or fold

+ When there are more cards to come, your bluffs should rarely
be pure bluffs - that is to say, bets or raises that have little or no
chance of winning if you are called, even taking into account the
cards you may get on future rounds. Instead your early-round bets
should be semi-bluffs

+ For a pure bluff to work, your opponent or opponents must
generally fold immediately

+ Deciding whether to continue with a semi-bluff really
depends on how the next card affects your chances and how your
opponent's card seems to have affected his. Each individual round
should be evaluated separately

+ When all the cards are out, you obviously can no longer
semi-bluff. You have either made your hand or you haven't. So all
bluffs on the end are pure bluffs. They are bets or raises that you
do not expect to win if you are called.When you are sitting there knowing you have the worst hand,
knowing you cannot win by checking, knowing you cannot win by
calling your opponent's bet, the only question is whether or not to
try to bluff. You should not if you think the chances your
opponent will call are too great in relation to the pot odds you are
getting. You should if you think your opponent will fold often
enough for a bluff to show a profit. If there is $100 in the pot, you
should make a $20 bluff if you think your opponent will fold more
than once in six times. If there is $60 in the pot, you must assume
your opponent will fold more than once in four times before you
try to bluff. If there is $140 in the pot, your opponent needs to fold
more than once in eight times. But, of course, the larger the pot, the better pot odds your opponent is getting to call your bet and
the more likely it is he will call with any kind of a fair hand

+ It is rarely correct to try to bluff out two or more people when
all the cards are out; your chances of success decrease
geometrically with each additional player in the pot. Paradoxically
you might have a profitable bluffing opportunity against each of
two opponents individually, but not against both of them as a
group

+ When you bluff, you are rooting for your opponent to fold
because that is the only way you can win the pot. When you bet
for value, you are rooting for your opponent to call because you
want your legitimate hand to win one more bet from him. It is
important to realize that it may be right to bet a fair hand for
value, and it may also be right to bluff, but it is almost never right
to do neither. If you decide you can't get away with a bluff on the
end when you miss your hand, then you should bet for value when
you do make your hand

+ Similarly, when you don't think a value bet is justified with
a fair hand, since your opponent will only call if he has you beat,
then if you miss your hand, you should usually bluff. For when
you bluff, it is possible your opponent will throw away his fair
hands

+ You must, of course, consider your opponent when deciding
whether to bet a fair hand for value or to bluff. Against a perpetual
caller, obviously you should rarely bluff. However, against such
a player you should bet any hand that you figure is a reasonable
favorite to be the best hand. In contrast, against a tough player
capable of tough folds, you can get away with bluffs more often,
but you should be more reluctant to bet your fair hands for value.
A tough opponent is not likely to pay you off with his worse
hands, and when he does call, he's likely to show down a hand
that beats you

### Game theory in Poker

+ When using game theory to decide whether to bluff, you must
first determine your chances of making your hand. You must then
determine the odds your opponent is getting on that bet. Then you
must randomly bluff in such a way that the odds against your
bluffing are identical to your opponent's pot odds.Here's one more example. Suppose you have a 20 percent
chance of making your hand, there's $100 in the pot, and the bet
is $25. Your opponent is then getting $125-to-$25 or 5-to-1 odds
if you bet. The ratio of your good hands to your bluffs should,
therefore, be 5-to-1. Since you have a 20 percent chance of
making your hand, you should randomly bluff 4 percent of the
time. (20 percent-to-4 percent equals 5-to-1.) When you bluff in
this fashion, you take optimum advantage of the situation.A good, convenient way to randomize your bluffs, as we have
seen, is to pick cards from among those you haven't seen. If, for
example, ten cards make your hand and you need a 5-to-1 bluffing
ratio, then you should pick two additional cards to bluff with.Here is another example. You draw one card to a spade flush
in draw poker, and your opponent draws three cards. Therefore,
the chances are enormous that your opponent will not be able to
beat a flush, only a bluff. The pot contains $20. The bet is $10. If you bet, your opponent is getting $30-to-$10 or 9-to-3 odds from
the pot. Since nine unseen spades make your flush, you should
pick three additional cards to bluff with, such as the two red 4s
and the 4 of clubs. You now bet with twelve cards creating a
9-to-3 ratio between your good hands and your bluffs.
It is not always possible to use cards to arrive at exactly the
ratio you need to bluff optimally. However, as long as you are
close, you can still expect to gain. You recall that choosing six
cards to bluff with in the draw lowball example created exactly
the right proportion vis-a-vis the pot odds my opponent was
getting; nevertheless, I still ended up with a profit when I bluffed
with five or with seven cards whether my opponent called or
folded. Of course, the closer you are to the exact ratio, the better,
in terms of game theory

+ When using game theory to decide whether to call a possible
bluff - assuming your hand can beat only a bluff and assuming
your judgment doesn't give you a hint - you must determine the
odds your opponent is getting on a bluff. Make the ratio of your
calls to your folds the same as those odds. If your opponent is
getting 4-to-1 odds on a bluff, you must call randomly four out of
five times to make that bluffing unprofitable

+ Players who bluff with approximately the correct frequency
are dangerous opponents because they often force you into the position of making an incorrect play. Therefore, it is important to
try to stop or induce bluffs to lead opponents away from correct
bluffing strategy.
You should normally induce a bluff against players who
already bluff too much and stop bluffs against players who
already bluff too little.In the first case, you are in a situation where you would have
to call if your opponent bets. By inducing a bluff, you increase
your chances of winning that last bet since your opponent will bet
more hands - including his bluffs - that you can beat than he
otherwise would.In the second case, against someone who bluffs too little, you
feel you would have to fold if that opponent bets, even though
there is some chance he might be bluffing. By stopping his bluffs,
you reduce the opponent's chances of winning since he will bet
only when he has made his hand, and you can comfortably fold.Besides artificial means, you try to induce a bluff by showing
weakness on an earlier round; you stop a bluff by showing
strength on an earlier round. Thus, inducing a bluff is something
akin to slowplaying, and stopping a bluff is something akin to
semi-bluffing.When you induce a bluff, you plan to call if your opponent
bets since you have increased the chances he is bluffing. When
you stop a bluff, you plan to fold if your opponent bets since you
have reduced or even completely eliminated the chances he is
bluffing

+ An obvious ploy to stop a bluff is to reach for your chips as
though you're anxious to call. If your opponent still comes out
betting, fully expecting you to call, you throw away your hand. Of
course, you have to use this play against the right player. An
experienced player who sees you reaching for chips and suspects
what you are up to is all the more likely to come out bluffing,
fully expecting you to fold

+ A ploy to induce a bluff is to give the impression you intend
to fold your hand. Now if your opponent bets, you call. But once
again an experienced player who sees through the ploy might not
bet without a good hand; realizing a bluff won't work, that player
saves money when he or she has nothing

### How to play heads-up poker

+ Last Position Play
  + If you are second to act when all the cards are out and your
opponent bets
    +  Call if your hand is not worth a raise but has a better
chance of winning than the pot odds you are getting.
Your chances of winning are the sum of the chances that
your opponent is bluffing, plus the chances that your
hand can beat his legitimate hand
    +  Raise if your opponent will still be the underdog after
calling your raise. Raise also as a bluff if you think it
will work often enough to have positive expectation
Also consider raising with what appears to be a calling
hand if your opponent is capable of throwing away a
better hand than yours for one more bet
  + If you are second to act when all the cards are out and your
opponent checks
    +  Bluff if you think it will work often enough,
remembering that a bluff does not tend to work as often
in second position as it might in first position
    + Bet your hand for value if you are a favorite to have the
best hand, even when your opponent calls your bet
    + Don't bet in close situations to avoid a check-raise

+ First Position Play
  + If you are first to act when all the cards are out and have a
very strong hand
    + Try to check-raise if your opponent will bet and call
your raise more than half as often as he will call you
when you bet
    + Come out betting if you don't think a check-raise will
work often enough to be profitable or if you think you
can win three bets when your opponent raises and you
reraise
  + If you are first to act and have a bad hand
    + Bluff if you can get away with it often enough for the
play to have positive expectation
    + Otherwise check and fold if your opponent bets
  + If you are first to act and have a hand that is a favorite to win
if called but not strong enough for you to try a check-raise
    + Bet if your opponent will call with more hands than he
will bet with if you check
    + Check and call if your opponent will bet with more
hands than he will call with
    + Never check and fold
  + If you are first to act and have a hand that is a small underdog
to win when your bet is called
    + Bet if your opponent will call with more hands than he
will bet, as long as some of the hands he would have bet,
had you checked, would be worse than yours. Check and
call if you think your opponent will check behind you
with a significant number of hands better than yours but
might still bluff with some hands you can beat
    + Check and call if your opponent will bet with more
hands than he will call with, as long as your pot odds
make it worth calling when he does bet
    + Check and fold if your opponent will almost never bet a
hand worse than yours

### Reading hands

+ There are two universally applicable techniques for reading
hands. Most commonly you
analyze the meaning of an opponent's check, bet, or raise, and in
open-handed games you look at his exposed cards and try to judge
from them what his entire hand might be. You then combine the
plays he has made throughout the hand with his exposed cards
and come to a determination about his most likely hand

+ Reading hands well is a powerful poker weapon because it
allows you to play correctly more often, according to the
Fundamental Theorem of Poker. The better you read your
opponents' hands, the less likely you are to play your hand
differently from the way you would play it if you could actually
see what your opponents had. Weak players are difficult to read
because there is little pattern to their play. Good players are easier
because there is logic to their play. However, very tough players
are more difficult to read because of their ability to disguise their
hands.One way to read hands is to put opponents on a variety of
possible hands and eliminate some of them on the basis of their
play and the cards they catch from one round to the next, keeping
track of the order in which they catch their cards. A second, complementary way is to work backward, looking at an
opponent's later plays in terms of how he played his hand in
earlier rounds

+ You can also read hands by using mathematics, by comparing
possible hands on the basis of Bayes' Theorem. If you know an
opponent will bet only certain hands, you form a ratio based on
the probability of that opponent being dealt each of those hands.
To simplify, you can divide his possible hands between those you
can beat and those you can't beat. The ratio tells you which of the
hands he is favored to have.Finally, when reading hands you must consider the number
of people in the pot. When there is a caller ahead of you, the caller
and the original bettor cannot both be bluffing, so you must play
on the assumption that you are up against at least one legitimate
hand. When there is a raiser ahead of you with the same standards
as yours, you should have more than your minimum raising hand
to call that raiser because you have to figure your minimal raising
hand is beat

### Psychology of Poker

+ The psychology of poker is an important aspect of the game.
You should think not only about what your opponents have, but
about what they think you have and about what they think you
think they have. You must go through such thought processes
against good players in particular, but the better they are, the more
difficult it is to figure them out. When you get to the expert level,
the process sometimes becomes so complex and tenuous that you
have to fall back on game theory.On the other hand, these thought processes can be costly
against weak players because
your opponents are not thinking on such an advanced level. Against weak players the best strategy is to play your cards in a
basic, straightforward way

+ Thinking about what your opponent is thinking will improve
your calling and betting strategy. If an opponent is sure you will
call his bet, he is not bluffing; if he thinks you will fold, he may
be bluffing. By the same token, if an opponent thinks you are
strong, you may be able to bluff, but you should not bet a fair
hand for value. If an opponent thinks you are weak, you can't
bluff, but you can bet your fair hands for value.Ordinarily you evaluate a poker play solely on its own merits,
but you can occasionally make a bad play for psychological effect
- to create an impression for the future.The psychology of poker is an extension of reading hands and
using deception in the play of your own hands, and thus it is an
extension of the Fundamental Theorem of Poker
 
+ When deciding whether to call, your
risk is a bet, and your reward is the pot. Any poker decision can
be put into these terms. What do you have to gain (including
future benefits on subsequent hands) by making a particular play?
What do you have to lose? The ability to evaluate properly the
risk-reward ratio for any poker decision is the ultimate test on the
road to becoming a champion poker player

+ Accurately and quickly analyzing risk-reward decisions at the
poker table in the heat of a hand comes only with experience.
Some top players do it intuitively. Most of the
time, when the choice of plays is problematic, your best play is
the one likely to be correct more than 50 percent of the time.
However, when the favored play has very bad consequences when
it is wrong, and the less-favored play has only slightly bad
consequences when it is wrong, it may be correct to choose the
less favored play


+ There are endless kinds of mistakes you can detect in your opponents' play, and when you detect them, there is always a way to take advantage of them. Following is a list of the most common mistakes poker players make, accompanied by the best strategies to use to take advantage of the mistakes:
