I wrote a thread yesterday on how I lead a Pareto life. Turning it into a blogpost (with some minor edits)

**/threadstarts**

I hate using my brain too much. I believe in doing the least amount of work to get max output

Here is how I have perfected a life of 80/20

- My personal life run on [OKRs which I plan during the beginning of the year](https://manassaloi.com/2020/01/15/personal-OKRs-2020.html)

- Professional based on weekly goals set with my Manager on Monday mornings, and with team on Tuesdays

- I have created frameworks so that my team can arrive at decisions with or without my help

- Frameworks for everything: [Career](https://manassaloi.com/2020/01/25/career-frameworks.html), [Personal life](https://manassaloi.com/2020/01/26/personal-life-frameworks.html), [How to learn](https://manassaloi.com/2019/03/08/how-to-learn.html), [Even learning football](https://manassaloi.com/2020/02/02/learning-football.html)

- Templates for everything. I hated sending out product update mails earlier because I always ended up spending a lot of time on the mail template. Now that [I have a template](https://manassaloi.com/2020/03/28/sending-product-update-mail.html) which I can reuse for all my mails, I just copy paste the content and I am done in an hour instead of taking days like earlier

- After templates, and frameworks, comes processes. I love optimising my workflow. [Link to how I run retrospectives at work](https://manassaloi.com/2020/03/29/retrospectives.html)

- Whenever I get more than a dozen questions on the same topic, [I write a blogpost](https://manassaloi.com/2020/01/17/twitter-rules.html) so that I don’t have to reply the same thing again and again


- My goal in H1'2020 is to complete all the templates here: [How to run a product team](https://manassaloi.com/2020/03/23/running-product-team.html), so that I can productise my job and get involved only in high leverage activities

- You might think coming up with the templates above took a lot of time. Nope. I just saw how PMs in my company run their processes. Which templates they use. How they send mails. Their work practices. Then I mixed the ones I liked with dozens of processes/templates from my previous companies, and suddenly, without putting in a lot of effort, I had my own processes, templates and frameworks. Just copy shit. There is no need to reinvent the wheel

- This website? I have been following various personal blogs for years now. I just kept bookmarking the ones I liked into a folder called 'Personal Website Ideas'. When I wanted my own site,  without putting in a lot of effort, I just mixed the look and feel of a few of my favourite ones, to come up with one I liked. I had the blog ready in days

- Content which I post here as well as social media?
  - Blog: I just think of things I would have liked to read when I was starting out in my career, and I just write about those things on my blog. Keep it simple
  - Twitter jokes: I just go to Linkedin, see people do dumb shit, and share my own take
  - Twitter threads: I just make up those on the go. Like I am doing now. I have no idea how this would shape up when I started. And how this would end. If I like the output, I will put it on my blog

- I barely edit my tweets before posting. It is something which is a waste of time

- Some people think I put a lot of time on Twitter. TBH I don't. I wrote this entire thread in 5 mins, and now I will move on to my next meeting

- This is the beauty of optimising on [processes over tools](https://manassaloi.com/2020/01/01/getting-shit-done-happiness.html)
