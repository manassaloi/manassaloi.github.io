title:  "How to be strategic"
---

'Hey Manas, You are not there yet when it comes to strategy. You can get things done, but you need to develop your strategy skills.' This is a feedback I got repeatedly from one of my past managers.

For a long time in my career, I had this reputation of someone who is a terrific execution guy - who gets shit done, but does not think long term/strategically. As I wanted to grow into a more senior role, I naturally decided to learn the mysterious strategic skills that was holding me back.

I read like a dozen books and hundreds of posts on competitive strategy. Not an exaggeration. I literally read a [dozen books](https://manassaloi.com/2019/08/27/learn-business-strategy.html).

Now I could draw flywheels and do 7 powers analysis in my sleep. Was it enough?

Nope. Because what people don't tell you is when they talk about strategy in middle management they don't actually mean strategy in a pure sense.

What they really want you to do is:
- Have a [charter document with the vision and mission for your team](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ssdq_GLyPFsxITzRfRR6aV3JErB3_VFsBhUmOj_4H0M/edit?usp=sharing).
- Know if you are on the right path while executing on your vision; know your [north star](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ssdq_GLyPFsxITzRfRR6aV3JErB3_VFsBhUmOj_4H0M/edit?usp=sharing)

Trust me, I have never seen anyone do 7 powers analysis or draw Porter's 5 forces diagram in any of the company I have worked at.

Just do all the things I mentioned above. That's it. Now you are someone who is strategic.
