title:  "Carthago delenda est"

---

While reading [Always Day One](https://manassaloi.com/booksummaries/2016/06/06/always-day-one-alex.html), I remembered this post on [how Zuckerberg led Facebook's war to crush Google Plus](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/06/how-mark-zuckerberg-led-facebooks-war-to-crush-google-plus), which I had read a few years back.

I realised that Mark Zuckerberg is the ultimate war time CEO who
- grew up idolizing Caeser and playing strategy games
- super competitive
- announces lockdowns when under threat
- wants to crush enemies, takes no prisoners
- evokes his inner Roman orator, and shouts 'Carthago delenda est'

For you it might be coronavirus, and not Google, which is an existential threat. Reading this blogpost will give you valuable insights on how to fight it.
