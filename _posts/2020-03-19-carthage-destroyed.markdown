title:  "Carthago delenda est"

---

While reading [Always Day One](https://manassaloi.com/booksummaries/2016/06/06/always-day-one-alex.html), I remembered this post on [how Zuckerberg led Facebook's war to crush Google Plus](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/06/how-mark-zuckerberg-led-facebooks-war-to-crush-google-plus), which I had read a few years back.

I realised that Mark Zuckerberg is the ultimate war time CEO who
- grew up idolizing Caeser and playing strategy games
- super competitive
- announces lockdowns when under threat
- wants to crush enemies, takes no prisoners
- evokes his inner Roman orator, and shouts 'Carthago delenda est'
