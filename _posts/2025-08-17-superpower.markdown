I’ve been a fan of Superpower since I read the founder’s blog on working through the [healthcare idea maze](https://maxmarchione.notion.site/From-then-till-now-what-I-tested-learned-Max-Marchione-9f4ffceab0ee448db30d285b2b09f5c4).

Have followed the company closely ever since.   Superpower has built a strong business in a crowded market. We can reuse parts of their approach (based on my study of the company) to build something similar.

The core loop is the Data, Trust, Advice flywheel.

Capture high-quality data, use a trusted agent to turn it into personalized insights, then recommend the next best action. Each accepted recommendation feeds back more data, sharpening both the model and the relationship.

The only things that matter initially are the quality of the data and the continuity of trust.

You need data that's both valuable and hard to capture. Superpower chose health because health data unlocks outsized value. Choose one wedge and solve the capture problem better than anyone else. You can layer on everything else later.

Your agent must clear three trust gates. First, competence, mirror a user’s raw data back to them so your accuracy is obvious. Second, alignment, be on the user’s side, not an advertiser’s, so skip affiliate links at the start and charge a subscription. Third, reliability, show up every time, hit uptime targets, meet compliance, and run evaluations that catch mistakes.

Sequence monetisation with care. Most teams try to take value before they create it, bolting on marketplaces and revenue share before users trust their basic recommendations. This kills the flywheel before it starts spinning.

The right sequence starts with what I call the mirror moment. You need to prove that you can ingest and reflect someone's world more accurately than any alternative. Spend as much time as needed getting it right. Track one metric: the share of data sources you connect and show on an interface without errors.

Then move to nudges. Surface low-friction, high-confidence actions, like swapping a snack or trying a peptide for a cold before it goes mainstream.

The marketplace phase, then your own products, is where real money sits. It only works once the agent is genuinely loved. People will let a trusted advisor broker product picks and take a cut, but they’ll leave the second it feels like you’re pushing stuff they don’t need.  You need to measure how often people actually follow your suggestions. If this rate is low, your trust hasn't been earned yet.
If it's high, only then you can start thinking about becoming a trusted marketplace.

The marketplace phase is where real money lives, but it only works after users genuinely love the agent. People will let a trusted advisor broker product recommendations and take a cut. They'll abandon anything that feels like it's selling them stuff they don't need.

Watch a few metrics. True Data Density, how much unique live info you collect per user per day. Advice Utilisation, who actually takes your suggestions. Outcome Delta, whether lives measurably improve. Referral Coefficient, how many users bring friends. And gross margins after advice delivery costs.

The moat isn't just having the data.

It's built in layers. You need the frameworks that map raw inputs to actionable goals. That takes real expertise. You need behavioural history, knowing which nudge style each user actually responds to. That cannot be copied, even if a competitor captures the same data you have. Over time, you can even capture regulatory advantages. Get first-in-class certifications, then lobby to make them table stakes for everyone else. At every step, the moat compounds, but only if you're patient and paranoid about breaking trust.

In a world where everyone's drowning in choices and information, the most valuable thing you can offer is a trusted concierge that knows users better than they know themselves. With permission to act on that knowledge, you can build something massive.
