I love the [10 things I can't live without GQ videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59Dy0bOq_Ng). Here are my essentials:
- My kindle [Read mostly fiction before I sleep.]
- Apple watch [Tracking calories burned.]
- Iphone [Primary phone.]
- One Plus 5 [Read most of my non ficion books on my phone, take notes, and also listen to podcasts and audiobooks.]
- Apple Airpods Pro [To take calls during the day.]
- One Plus bullets wireless [I don't carry my airpods when I go out because I listen to podcasts/ books on my One Plus Phone.]
- Mac Air M1 [Primary device.]
- PS4 [How else would I crush people on Fifa?]
- Dr Physio full body neck massager with heat [For massaging my legs and back before I sleep.]
- Caresmith CHARGE Cordless Massage Gun [Post football massage.]
