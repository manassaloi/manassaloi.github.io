title:  "Sell your work"
---

My biggest contribution to the Indian startup ecosystem is to get female PMs to get over their fear of selling their work.

This is just one conversation. 3 out of 4 PMs in my team are female. I have lost count of how many times I have had similiar conversations with them. And this is the most common advice during my mentorship sessions I conduct too.

This advice is applicable to female founders too.

In a world where everyone is selling/signalling implicitly anyway, there is no shame in being your own cheerleader. I work hard and shout about the same on Twitter everyday. I remind people at work. And teach my PMs to do the same.

I can hear you. 'Oh Manas, but it is not modest.'

Modesty is overrated. Work hard. And sell your work.
