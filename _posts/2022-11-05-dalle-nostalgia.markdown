title:  "Paying dall-e for nostalgia"
---

One of my earliest memories is lying on a mat outside my house with my family. There was no inverter then. So whenever electricity would go out, we would all go outside and wait for an hour. No electricity meant no need to study. And we stayed in the outskirts of the city. So you could see the stars. I have been trying to recreate that memory for a long time. But my drawing skills are limited.

I tried with DALLÂ·E. Yup, it is the first image. It is crazy how far AI has come. I would rather pay 8$ per month for nostalgia than for Twitter.
