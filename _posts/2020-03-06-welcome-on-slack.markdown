title: "Automated welcome message on Slack"

---

A PM in our company has set up a welcome bot message for anyone who joins her project channel on Slack.

{% include webp-image.html img="welcome_slack.png" alt="Bot welcome on Slack" %}

I am planning to add this to my product development workflow too. As we move towards an increasingly remote world, and start relying more on Slack, these small things will help a lot in improving collaboration IMHO.
