title:  "Habits I am tracking daily"
---

I track these habits on my Streaks app:
- Go out in the sun [I feel if I even spend 5 mins sitting in my balcony, it improves my mood]
- Workout 30 mins [Football, stretching, yoga, and sometimes weight training]
- Meditate 10 mins [I probably do 2 times a week, keep missing this]
- 5 min morning stretch [If I start my day with this, I feel so much better]
- Take vitamins [Easiest thing to do and mark one habit as done]
- Write less [Trying to be less verbose]
- Learn photography [I watch YT videos, read newsletters, and even take a few photos from time to time]
- Check if any bills due [This is so that I don't forget my bill]
- No vertical relationships [Read Courage to be Disliked to understand this idea]
- Spend quality time with wife [Easy to do this when you are both WFH, but never want to miss this]
- Football on feet [A friend recommended this to me, keeping a football with me at all times]
- Live experience to experience [Have to remember to do new things]
- Be happy [Thanks Naval]
- Don't rant on Twitter [Twitter is one thing I want to do less this year]

The days I play football, I track these habits related to my game:
- Analyse the game and add to my football diary [I do this with every new thing I pick up, check my Poker blog for context]
- Keep it simple [I started playing pretty late and just want to keep things simple]
- Stick to position [Otherwise I start running all around]
- Pre match stretching [So that I don't get injured]
- Warm up on the ground [If I warm up with the ball for even 5 mins, I tend to play better]
- Cool down [I keep missing this]
