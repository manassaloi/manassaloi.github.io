title:  "Aha moment for agents"
---

Since I wrote [this post on aha moments](https://manassaloi.com/2024/12/20/zepto-aha-moment.html), I have been thinking about 'aha' moments for AI agents.

The best 'aha' moment post I have ever read is [this one](https://avc.com/2016/06/best-seed-pitch-ever/) by Fred Wilson on Twilio's seed pitch.

One principle when it comes to communicating products is 'show, don't tell'.

What I see: Every agent website and video shows complicated workflows with flowcharts.

The only good demo/launch video I have seen is Alex Cohen's Hello Patient.

A good demo of an imaginary product: You are a founder building an insurance voice agent product and you want to sell it to HDFC. Go to their call centre. You probably have a local LLM running on a truffle (simpforsatoshi) like device. You open your briefcase. Take it out. No data leaves. You start making calls. Sell more insurance than the best agent in the call centre. Far higher productivity. Lower costs.

A new form factor is interesting. Of course you can use cloud providers.

I know that is not possible today. You would need to get data from actual prospects before making that call. You would have to follow HDFC's guidelines (build a RAG solution) and then also fine tune your model to better suit HDFC. And the fine-tuning itself would take time. And they would not share it without signing a contract. So the 'aha' moment is not immediate. Nobody's mind is going to be blown immediately. And that the a problem.
