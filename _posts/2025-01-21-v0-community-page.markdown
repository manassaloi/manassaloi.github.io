I am super happy that v0 has this new community page out on home.

If everything is a remix, and very few people have original design ideas or content, then the ability to remix helps you get far more users than expecting them to come up with something new.

This is why I always felt Twitter should have a remix button. The grok button is nice, but a remix button, rewriting some content in a different tone/voice, and posting it as an original tweet will 100X the creation on the platform.

If this idea makes you cringe, just know that most popular accounts just rewrite content.

I see the same tweets paraphrased and then posted for far wider distribution than the original tweet.

This is democratizing content. Slop machine at scale.
