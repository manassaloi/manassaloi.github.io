title:  "Why does Swiggy have a promo banner?"
---

"Genuine q: do many people see/interact with the banner on an app's homepage? Doesn't seem like a great use of prime real-estate. For me whenever I open an app it's a muscle-memory scroll/search to where the useful stuff is."

I saw someone post the above on x dot com. Here are my thoughts having worked on on demand marketplaces for 6 years now:

A significant number of users in low to medium intent products are "promo hunters".

Remove all banners around affordability and price perception and you will start seeing behavior change. Their frequency of ordering drops.

Start polling these users a few months later and they will say "competitor x has far better price", while when you compare final price on checkout for both they will be more or less the same. It is the discounting/ promos that drive that perception.

Giving a good deal is important for conversion.

Even more important: Making users feel like they are getting a good deal.

Users want to feel that they are getting a good deal from your platform.
