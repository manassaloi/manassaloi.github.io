title:  "My poker stats"

Whenever I post anything related to [Poker](https://manassaloi.com/2020/04/07/learning-poker.html) on Twitter, people DM me asking about my stats.

Here it is.

I mostly played tournaments online. I don't have stats from all the sites I played on. Adda52 is where I played the most, so I am sharing the data from there, the ~7L payout is revenue and not profit. I made money on Adda, but if you count my hourly rate, based on my tech job, I ofcourse did not make much. But Poker is mostly about fun. So I will just say that I had a lot of fun testing myself against the best players in the tournament scene. I mostly played mid stakes, and I would say I did alright.
