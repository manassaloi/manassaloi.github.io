title:  "Happiness is just a year away"
---

Last year during the 2nd wave, a lot of my friends left the country. I was also confused and was exploring my options.

Then my friend Brijesh told me to think about what I want out of life, basically unbundle my life, see what I am not getting here, and then evaluate if moving to Europe/ SE Asia will get me those. Not get swayed by emotion.

I was discussing my life with another mentor and all the trade offs we make. He was telling me that I was making a mistake by not moving to the US.

And then during the discussion I suddenly blurted out "Kitna bhagunga yaar. I thought becoming a PM would solve my life, I did not enjoy coding that much, and I would be happier. Then I set money goals. Once I have X in my bank account, I will be content. Then I thought SPM would be it. Then Lead PM. Now we are discussing the US, and if not the US, moving to Canada, getting the TN visa, then working in the US, maybe starting up there, and then finally the possibility that we will be happy. Happiness always feels one year away, a future goal."

I keep 2 times a year to think deeply about my career and life. My next check point is mid-year. And I find myself thinking a lot again: What's next?
