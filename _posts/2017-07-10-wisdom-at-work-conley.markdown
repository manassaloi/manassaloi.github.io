**This blogpost is not an exhaustive summary of the book. Just contains the notes I took.** 

I like to believe I was channeling Bill when I came up with my favorite question to ask my direct reports back at Joie de Vivre and then at Airbnb, “How can I support you to do the best work of your life here?” This question not only gave those who worked for me the sense that I wanted them to succeed, it also put some responsibility in their laps to help fashion a working relationship that would encourage them to make suggestions on how to improve their performance, rather than play the role of victim if they felt stymied in their career.
