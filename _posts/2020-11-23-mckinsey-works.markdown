title:  "How Mckinsey works"
---

I have been reading a lot on how consultants work: how they organize their time, how they manage stakeholders, how they present their work. And when it comes to consulting, Mckinsey is the gold standard.

Here are 3 of the best books on how they do their work.

1. Learn about issue trees, MECE, and more in [McKinsey Mind by Ethan M. Rasiel, Paul N. Friga](https://manassaloi.com/booksummaries/2016/04/20/mcKinsey-mind-ethan-paul.html).

2. Learn about TEAM FOCUS model in The [McKinsey Engagement by Paul N. Friga](https://manassaloi.com/booksummaries/2016/01/27/mckinsey-engagement-friga.html).

3. Learn about the 47 principles mentioned in The [McKinsey Edge: Success Principles from the World's Most Powerful Consulting Firm by Shu Hattori](https://manassaloi.com/booksummaries/2016/04/21/mcKinsey-edge-hattori.html).

Other books I have read on Mckinsey and consulting in general: [The firm](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16130157-the-firm) (history of Mckinsey), [The Secrets of Consulting by Gerald M. Weinberg](https://manassaloi.com/booksummaries/2016/05/29/secrets-of-consulting-gerald-weinberg.html) (the orange test mentioned in the book literally changed my life)

I am currently reading: [The Pyramid Principle by Barbara Minto](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33206.The_Minto_Pyramid_Principle). Here is a good summary of the book: [The Pyramid Principle](https://medium.com/lessons-from-mckinsey/the-pyramid-principle-f0885dd3c5c7)
