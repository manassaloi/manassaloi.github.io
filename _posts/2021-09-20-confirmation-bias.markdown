title:  "Confirmation bias"
---

The most popular tweets cater to people's confirmation bias.

- "bitcoin will go to 100K"
- "zomato's IPO is the start of a new era for tech in India"

Popular books do the same: "sleep is good" (Why we sleep), "generalists FTW" (Range).

If you want to write the next NYT best seller book just call it 'Twitter is the new resume' and fill it with content around why reading/sharing second hand knowledge as earned experience is somehow better than doing something concrete that develops your skills. You will collect a bucket load of likes and followers.
