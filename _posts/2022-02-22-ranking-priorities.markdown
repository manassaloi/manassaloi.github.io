title:  "Stack ranking priorities"
---

People keep cribbing about not finding time to read books. There are those who can't find 15 mins to catch up with old friends. I don't think it is due to lack of time. It is because you don't think they are priorities.

Let's be honest, if you really care about something, you will make time for it.

I have the same 24 hours as everyone else. Earlier, I used to have a long list of priorities. Now I have fewer, but I still find it useful to rank them.

Either at work or personal life, if I am not doing something, it is because that thing is not important compared to the top 5 things in my life.

Everything is a prioritisation problem eventually. Accept that. And then focus on your top 5 priorities.
