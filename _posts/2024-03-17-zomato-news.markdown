title:  "Zomato is always in the news"
---

A lot of chatter on Twitter about whether or not Zomato was right to sort food orders according to colour. Whether you really need a 15-minute delivery time for a PS5 on Blinkit orders. Do people really buy gold on Blinkit on Dhanteras?  All of these are interesting to think about and to discuss. But the meta point is: Zomato has found a way to stay in the news and get everyone talking about them.

Do you remember the last time there was a discussion about Instamart on Twatter?

When product, design, technology and even delivery are pretty much the same for all delivery apps, the winner has to make sure they're the first thing people think of when they're hungry or shopping. Zomato, especially Deepinder, has really figured out how to do this.
