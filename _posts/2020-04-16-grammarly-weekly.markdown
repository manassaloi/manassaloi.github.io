Grammarly's weekly stats mail must be one of the best email marketing content I have seen. Why?

1/ It starts with 'vanity' to drive a higher CTR. You feel like opening the mail to see why they called you a 'legend'.

I know Grammarly has access to everything I have been typing for the last few days. So guess they would have some genuine insights.

2/ Once you enter they continue from the subject line. There is a strong connection between the first part of the body with the subject line.

Gives you stats which further massages your vanity.

3/ Starts talking about your streak. Brings gamification into the picture.

This is a bit meh though! Since I have the extension, everything I type on Chrome counts towards the streak.

Maybe the streak could have been turned into a challenge? Something more difficult to achieve.

4/ After vanity, they come to some sentiment analysis. For a metrics junkie like me, this was super interesting. Would I want to improve on the 'Confident' part? Am I lacking on the 'Encouraging' part?

This is similar to PlayStore's sentiment analysis of Reviews.

5/ Then after making you feel good about yourself, telling you how you are faring, they finally come to the parts where you can be better.

Some products would put this at the top. And turn this into a scare tactic for using their Product. Not Grammarly. They are your pals.

6/ They also give you a CTA to upgrade to Grammarly Premium. But it does not come off as pushy.

They also have a hook for Grammarly Business which is their B2B product. But it is at the bottom of the email.

7/ Apps like Duolingo have become associated with aggressive tactics to boost their apps' engagement.

Grammarly takes the opposite approach: Being your cheerleader.
