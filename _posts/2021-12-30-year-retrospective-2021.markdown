title:  "Reflection on 2021"
---

I did not set any goals for 2021. I am a person who is obsessed with systems and [lives his life through daily habits](https://manassaloi.com/2021/11/28/forming-habits.html) and [yearly OKRs](https://manassaloi.com/2020/12/31/okrs-2020-update.html).

I wanted to see if I change how I live my day if I don't set any goals.
  - Would I read less?
  - Would I try out more new things?
  - What were the things I would cut out from my life that I was doing out of sheer habit?
  - What would be the new additions to my life?

Instead of OKRs with timelines, I created a list of things I wanted to do for 2021 if I got time. I did not obsess over this list. I did not even check it out every week. If I was bored and wanted ideas I would look at the list for inspiration.

Instead of updating my personal OKRs list monthly like the years before, I just created a note where I captured what I did during the year. Anything that was important to me went into it.

Oh yeah, somewhere during the middle of the year, I did write down my priorities for the year because I kept doing too many things and wanted to see if what I was doing mapped to the things that I had identified as a priority.

I identified these as my 3 biggest priorities for 2021
- Health (physical and mental)
- Career
- Understand crypto

Let's see how it went.

**2021 recap:**
- Writing: 185 posts (original blogposts as well as book summaries.)
- Reading: ~110 books, average page size of 275.
- 100+ people attended private sessions on career and product management.

- Favourite board game: Splendor.
- 3 TV series I liked: People Just Do Nothing, Succession, It's always sunny in Philadelphia.
- 3 Movies I liked: Blade Runner 2049, Minnal Murali, Matrix.

- Bought my own poker set.
- Completed the Learn Cryptocurrency course by Preethi Kasireddy. Got bored midway and mostly skimmed though.

I had got Promoted to Manager from a Product Lead role last year and I wanted to get to the next level soon instead of the 'you only get one promotion in X years' narrative that companies start peddling once they get big. So I am definitely proud of this the most.

**November**

- Gifted sunglasses to my wife. She never had ones that fit, so we were super happy when she found something that did.
- Invested a small check in my friend's startup. A lot of inbound came this year, but I am not willing to double down on it till I think I have an edge. Spending most of my networth just to update my bio as angel investor is negative ROI.
- Gifted Galaxy S20 FE to my dad.
- Got a big stock grant. Now most of my network is tied to illiquid private market stocks.

**December**
- Updated my wife's website. I had created the site way back in January, but never got the chance to make it "look pretty."
- I also updated own website, especially the Uses this page.
- First proper vacation in 3 years since I joined my current company. First vacation with my wife since I met her 4 years back. I tried to stay off Slack, but failed. I attended calls only one day during the week I was in Goa, so I would count it as a positive.
- Bought an iPhone Pro and Airpods Pro for myself.
- Got Skillshare yearly subscription.
- Completed 2 photography courses on Skillshare.
- Gifted ETFs and MFs to my brother.

**Random Reflections:**
- I kept doing the same things that I have always done. Just because I did not set a Goodreads goal did not mean I read less. Just because I dont have analytics on my blog to push myself, I did not write fewer posts.
- Should have SIPed instead of investing during dips. I kept trying to time the market. And lost out on a lot of the upside. I have set up SIP from Jan'22.
- I am planning to create my [own money rules](https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/money-rules/) so that I know what I am spending my money on.
- I could have travelled more. A lot of my frinds utilised the WFH benefit by spending months in Goa/ Himachal.
- Should have doubled down on equity purchase. I knew FANG stocks were undervalued. I kept buying N100 instead. Chose the safer option.
- Could have bought more crypto, but getting my HDFC UPI blocked due to P2P transactions scared me and I did not bother post that. This was mostly lazyness on my part.
- Met a lot of new interesting people.
- Wrote 10+ posts on web3.
- For the longest time I was worried about money. Growing middle class does it to you. You feel that there is no safety net. You are one recession away from becoming jobless and eventually homeless. I have not had a really close relationship with my family, hence I could never rely on them in case things did not work out for me. Ever since I was a kid, I have been obssessed about reaching a stage in life where I don't have to worry about money anymore. I had a number in my head. I hit that last year. Since then I have been pretty relaxed about gifting things to family, picking the tab when I go out with my friends, even splurging myself if I feel like. Most of my money habits are still linked to that old mental state of fear and loss aversion.
- I started tracking my daily habits far more aggressively this year. I am not getting any younger. Health has the biggest correlation to happiness, and I need to take it seriously.
- Seeing so many friends move abroad, Europe and US, did make me think a lot on whether I am making the right decision to stay back here. A lot of mental energy went into figuring out what I really want out of my life and whether I can get them while living in India. I don't want to make decisions based on FOMO. I want to do what makes my life better in the long run.
- I love learning new things. I get excited whenever I do a new course and learn some new skill. I am planning to do a lot more courses in 2022.
- I spent way more time shitposting on Twitter than I intended. Failure to cut down my Twitter has been one of the biggest failures of 2021.
- I loved tracking my monthly highlights. It is one way of me remembering what happened during the year. The highlights I put also implicitly shows what I care about the most.
- With covid not going anywhere, time will continue to fly by and every day will feel the same. This is even more so if you are in your late 20s/early 30s. So I recommend doing a similiar exercise. Ask yourself what did you do this March? Do you remember?
- This reflection is mostly for me and hence I won't share this on Twitter. Hope this inspires you to write your own.
