title:  "How I spend my workday"

How I spend my office hours:

1. Joining meetings (sometimes post office hours too).
2. Reading (interspersed with meetings).
3. Playing with new products, both internal and external.
4. Covering quarterly updates of public companies on Quartr app.
5. Thinking (I spend at least an hour thinking about different ideas related to the building of products).
6. Chatting with stakeholders and addressing their concerns.
7. Also tweeting. But it doesn't take up much of my time as I vomit out whatever comes into my head.

Writing down my thoughts is also part of thinking (point 5). Thinking can be about things related to Gojek (highest priority) or about some abstract concept that I am thinking about.
