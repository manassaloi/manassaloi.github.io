The e/acc movement has become cringe because the creation of a movement is the last step in the creation of a startup/ecosystem.

Steps for building a startup: Find an inflection, uncover a novel insight, test a bunch of ideas around that insight, build and scale one of them, and start a movement (h/t Mike Maples).

e/acc jumped straight to the last step without building anything. Co-opted by clout chasers who found it easier to change their twatter user name than shipping anything of value.

P.S Even the Bitcoin Bros used their laser eyes after years of growing the crypto ecosystem.
