title:  "Stop doing product courses"
---

To get better at product, you don't need to take more product management courses or read more product management frameworks from Reforge. You need to use more products, *think* more about various product decisions, and actually ship stuff.

I've seen PMs I've worked with post on Linkedin about the latest course they took, but they barely cared about their jobs, nor would they spend any time getting better at the craft of building products.

I've met founders who bitch about the PMs in their companies, people who've never had a new idea in their lives, can't write a strategy document to save their lives, don't care about design, don't care about data, don't spend time tinkering on side projects. This is why many developers and designers hate PMs.

You don't need another course. You just need to care more.
