title:  "Multiple apps: Bytedance style"
---

ByteDance started by launching dozens of experimental apps that catered to different TGs. I think this playbook can be reused.

You can see language learning, workout, mental health app creators doing this today.

I can 100% certain that there is a billion dollar company waiting to be made in the spiritual space using the same playbook.
