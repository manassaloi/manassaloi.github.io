title:  "Things no one will tell you on Twitter"
---

Happy to announce that I have decided to become 10X more blunt in my blogposts going forward. Here is a list of things I wish people talked on Twitter instead of virtue signalling all day.

**Flat organisation is a myth and there are always invisible ladders.**

- A company I worked at claimed to be flat on paper. But at the same level a few people would get stock grants but others won't. Why?
- Another company calls everyone a PM on paper, but they issue special grants to people above X level. Why?
- Everyone is same, but there are secret private slack channels where you get entry based on either internal levels or proximity to leadership. Why?
- If you get marked as a critical hire, you get more % hike than the standard % hikes announced to the rest of the company. Why?
- When there are flat organisations, instead of a transparent ladder that everyone can see and climb, people create hidden ladders and groups. In another flat organisation I worked at where people cringed at the thought of awarding public titles, there are actual meetings where HR sits with you and goes through your reports - making them as critical hires, people you can let go of, people who can be fast tracked to promo, possible replacement for critical hires. Why?
- In the absence of transparency there is 10X more hidden politics.
- The only people who don't care about titles are already at the top of their function. Why would they care if their title is Head of X or a VP?
- The same people who say titles don't matter go to conferences and announce their titles.

**Most Product Managers are glorified Project Managers.**

- Whenever I hear a PM in my organisation or someone I mentor crib about doing project management and having to execute what their leaders want, the first question I ask is "when was the last time you actually talked to your customers or spent a day looking at data that helped uncover some key insight?"
- If you think logically no CEO would want to self sabotage their company by working on things that don't matter. The problem is that they have too much on their plate, and hence can't go deep and focus on breadth instead. If you are the PM it is on you to do the research on behalf of your CEO and helped show why you should be doing X over Y. Most people won't though. Because it is far easier to blame their CEO or HOP.
- How do I know this? I have also been this situations where I stopped giving a fuck and just became execution machines. BTW I am not saying all CEOs are rationale and everything is your fault as a PM. [But first do your homework before blaming your CEO.](https://manassaloi.com/2021/01/13/planning-feature.html)

**Most people on Twitter are grifters who have not done any real work for years.**

- I see so much gyaan on Twitter by people that does not match the reality of what they actually do in their organisation. How do I know this? By now I have enough friends in the ecosystem that I can ask them and get the real view on people.
- Why do I do this? I have lost count of people who have joined organisations based on Twitter gyaan by their managers and once inside they realised what they preach comes nothing close to what they practice. You can see a related whatsapp screen shot in [this post](https://manassaloi.com/2021/09/13/twitter-virtue-signalling.html).
- Please do a reference check before joining someone's team. Don't just go by Twitter or Linkedin gyaan. Will save you months of pain if not years.
- Another question to ask before you take someone's gyaan on Twitter seriously: What impactful project has they shipped in the last 6 months? If you can't ask them this directly, ask someone in their company.

**People hate being called out even if they are not called out.**

- I wrote that most leaders don't follow what they preach on Twitter a few days back. People started instantly debating with me on this simple statement. Why? I never call out people using actual names. I don't even hint. You would get pissed with these tweets only if you self identify as one of these gyaanis.
- Then another friend gave me an insight that makes a lot of sense - If you call people by names, you don't leave anything to ambiguity. People don't feel you are talking about them. You also signal to both of their lovers and haters. People who love them will argue. People who hate will like, retweet. But when you write generic statements, then it causes anxiety. People start wondering what if he is writing about me? This stresses out people more. Now instead of the case where the person being called out by name hating you, you are hated by the entire ecosystem. Because lets face it there are actually a lot of grifters and full time gyaanis on Twitter.
- So going forward I will just try keep my mouth shut on Twitter and write here instead.

**People are not actually kind. The same discussions are happening in private groups.**

- As you grow in your career you start realising a lot of things that you never knew. One of it is the existence of these private whatsapp and telegram groups where people shit on other people. I have always been the kind of person who would rather pick up a fight in public with someone than shit on them in private. But that is a career limiting strategy. So what happens instead is that people shit on others in private, but act as best friends on Twitter. I have lost count of how many times I have had 1-1 DM with 2 people on Whatsapp where they were actually shitting on each other. But bring the same 2 people in a group and they would not say a word.
- If people were actually kind, I would have been the odd one out. Ranting and venting on Twitter and Whatsapp. But what is actually true is that most people lack the courage to voice their opinions for fear of public disagreement. Hence they survive in hidden Whatsapp groups where they can shit on others in peace.
- Also just because you poor people don't know the bad leaders/managers in the ecosystem does not mean others don't too. Sadly these info will lie again in these private groups and no one will dare call these people out in public.

**The world is not as meritocratic as people on Twitter would want you to believe.**

- Do you know that interviews can be fast tracked if you know the manager in a company? Not all, but many.
- Do you know that people have hidden list of companies, engineering schools they want to hire from?

**Correlation is not causation when it comes to culture.**

- There is a company where people thought that they had the best culture. Leaders used to go to every conference possible and shout about how great their culture is.
- They took pride in not having titles (at least officially). They even hid what levels everyone in the org was at. They thought they actually grew because of these practices instead of inspite of it.
- Then over 6 months they bled people after people till leadership actually accepted they had an attrition problem. Then they started paying one time bonuses out of cycle to retain people.
- What they attributed to culture was just them paying top of the market salary and transparency. Once the company scaled and they could not maintain both, people left for greener pastures. This makes me wonder if culture does actually matter?
- Look at the hiring woes in the Indian startup ecosystem. If culture actually matter won't select companies with better culture (however you measure it) have an easier time hiring as well as retaining employees? Makes you think doesn't it?
