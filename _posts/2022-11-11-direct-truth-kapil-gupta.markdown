**Note:** While reading a book whenever I come across something interesting, I highlight it on my Kindle. Later I turn those highlights into a blogpost. It is not a complete summary of the book. These are my notes which I intend to go back to later. Let's start!

Q: Who am I?
A: That which remains when you remove all the things that you are not.
Q: What things am I not?
A: All that you believe yourself to be.

A: I did not say that you should do anything.
Q: But what is the point of doing it if it does not help me arrive at my goal?
A: If you examine it sincerely, it will take you somewhere. If you use it as a crutch or a prescription, it will take you nowhere.

A: This conversation is moving in a fruitless direction.
Q: Why?
A: It is turning into a conversation in which you are trying to compel me to convince you of something. I have no interest in convincing you, or coaxing you into anything. I simply provide direct Truth. I do not wish to convince you of it.

Q: How is it that attachment has produced all of these problems between me and my children?
A: Attachment gives birth to hope and need. If you are attached to them, you will need them to do certain things, achieve certain things, be a certain way, and behave toward you in a certain way. When they do not, it will cause you pain. When you experience pain,  you  will  behave  toward  them  in  a  way  that  pain  compels  you  to  behave.  And they  will  behave  toward  you  in  a  way  that  their  need  for  freedom  compels  them  to behave. And this will continue for the rest of your lives.

A: Behavior is the leaf of a tree. Understanding is its root. I will not tell you how to arrange  your  leaves.  I  will  only  tell  you  to  proceed  by  way  of  understanding.
Understand the consequences of your motivations. If the consequences are acceptable to you, you may choose to proceed. If they are not, you may choose to examine your motivations.

Q: Is it my responsibility to give them freedom?
A:  It  isn’t  a  question  of  responsibility.  It  is  a  question  of  living  in  accordance  with nature.
Q: Yet you do not believe in responsibilities?
A: No.
Q: Why, if I may ask?
A: Responsibility is a societal creation. No one is truly responsible for another. You do not  owe  your  children  anything.  They  do  not  owe  you  anything.  If  you  wish  to  do, then  do.  If  they  wish  to  do,  they  may  also  do.  That  which  comes  from  the  heart  is natural  and  satisfying.  That  which  comes  from  the  idea  of  responsibility  is  forced, artificial, and often produces resentment and the expectation for reciprocation.

A:  Do  not  look  at  this  from  the  standpoint  of  blame.  For  this  will  lead  to  further problems. The most fruitful realizations are quiet ones.
Q: Thank you. Can you please help me move forward?
A: Understand that you are the architect of this relationship. And, in many ways, the architect of your son’s fate. Become the person he would seek to embrace. Provide a place  of  peace  that  he  is  looking  for  in  the  wrong  places.  As  he  recognizes  that  you have transformed from a place of need, into a source of quiet comfort, he will come.
And he will listen.

Q: From where does addiction arise?
A: The mind.
Q: How does this happen?
A: The mind peddles in desire. It has an unending appetite for desire. It is a wanting machine. It cannot get enough of that which it enjoys. This is the seed of addiction.

A: All humans are pleasure addicts. Alcohol and drugs are only a detail.
Q: In what way are they pleasure addicts?
A: In what way are they not?
Q: Is pleasure a bad thing?
A: There is no good or bad.
Q: What is the problem with being a pleasure addict?
A: If you remove the word ‘pleasure’ from your question, does the question change for you?
Q: Yes. But I don’t know how to ask it.
A: All addiction creates bondage.
Q: But what is the problem with pleasure?
A: Pleasure is ubiquitous in the lives of humans. As the mind is ubiquitous in the lives of humans. From morning until night, a human seeks nothing other than pleasure. In the  smallest  thing.  And  the  largest  thing.  All  addictions  stem  from  this  one characteristic of mind.
Q: But the opposite of pleasure is pain. And why would anyone want pain?
A: It is the search for pleasure that produces pain.
Q: What would be the nature of a person’s life if he did not seek pleasure?
A:  He  would  live  a  life  of  equanimity.  He  would  be  content  and  complete  in  each moment.  Though  he  may  involve  himself  in  lofty  pursuits,  his  contentedness  and completeness would go with him. He would have abandoned the ceaseless chase. And when a man no longer feels the need to chase, life begins to chase him.

Q: Should I not subscribe to religion?
A: There is no should.
Q: Is it wrong to subscribe to religion?
A: There is no right or wrong.
Q: Is it bad to subscribe to religion?
A: There is no good or bad.

Q: Do you think meditativeness is more powerful than meditation?
A: Whether it be meditativeness or meditation, it must be an effect rather than a goal.
That which one pursues as a goal never arrives. Any prescription that one pursues, he becomes imprisoned to.

A: Man is lazy and undisciplined for the things that do not move him. He is motivated and voracious for the things that inspire him.
Q: So discipline doesn’t matter?
A: Discipline is an attempt to force oneself to do that which he fundamentally does not wish to do.
Q: But in order to achieve, one needs discipline.
A:  It  is  far  more  fruitful  to  evaluate  the  desires  for  achievement,  than  it  is  to  force discipline. If one’s desire for achievement is pure, he will be sufficiently motivated to do  all  that  needs  to  be  done  in  order  to  achieve.  If  it  is  not,  he  will  play  clever  and ineffective games such as discipline.
Q: So never force yourself to do anything?
A: Forcing oneself is short-lived. As all things that are insincere are short-lived. If one is  honest  and  sincere  about  his  motivations,  he  will  move  with  himself,  instead  of against himself.

Q: What is an example of a Journey toward the Ultimate?
A: If you made an additional billion dollars, would this satisfy you?
Q: No.
A: If you pursued meditation, would this satisfy you?
Q: I do meditate. But it’s more of a practice. It hasn’t really led me anywhere.
A:  The  single  most  important  characteristic  of  a  Journey  toward  the  Ultimate  is  that upon  reaching  it,  one  becomes  satisfied  for  the  rest  of  his  life.  For  he  becomes  life itself.  He  arrives  at  a  place  in  which  there  is  no  longer  any  need  to  strive,  practice, search, or crave. The end of emotional turmoil, the end of conflict, the end of sorrow, the end of anxiety. He has arrived. And now he can live as only a free man can.

A:  That  the  successful  identify  themselves  as  successes.  While  those  who  struggle identify  themselves  as  unfortunate  failures.  The  successful  view  themselves  as conquerors. While those who struggle view themselves as victims of circumstance.
Q:  Why  would  an  individual  view  himself  as  a  victim  of  circumstance,  rather  than become a conqueror?
A: The fear of having to leave behind the comfort of his identity. The fear of loss.
Q: The fear of loss? He already loses. What more could he lose?
A: The luxury of self-pity. The sympathies of victimhood. Such things are not easily sacrificed.

A: Fear is the natural consequence of man not knowing himself.
Q: Can you please explain?
A: The fundamental basis of all fear is fear of oneself.
Q: Why does man fear himself?
A:  Man  seeks  pleasure  for  himself.  He  seeks  stability  for  himself.  He  seeks  egoic satisfaction.  He  seeks  many  things  in  order  to  make  himself  feel  a  certain  way.  Any situation that threatens how he feels about himself will bring fear.
Q: What is the way out of fear?
A: If a man achieved a rock bottom steady state with himself. If he had a relationship with,  or  an  understanding  of,  himself  that  was  unshakeable.  He  would  become immune to fear.

Q: What is time?
A: Time is thought.
Q: Can you please explain?
A:  Have  you  ever  had  an  experience  in  which  you  have  lost  yourself  in  something?
Music, an activity, a journey?
Q: Yes.
A: Did time exist?
Q: No. Time disappeared.
A: Yes. Time comes into existence when man begins to think.
Q: When does man not think?
A: When he has discovered the cocoon of the present moment, thinking ceases. When he arrives at a state of No-Mind, time comes to an end.

Q: But I have always been told to love myself. And to improve myself.
A: Yes.
Q: Is this not correct?
A: One cannot love or improve something that does not exist.
Q: If what you say is true, then the entire self-help industry is a falsehood.
A:  There  is  no  self  to  be  improved.  But  you  are  welcome  to  carry  on  believing  that there is.
Q: I’d like to understand this. If I have anxieties, sorrows, disappointments, anger, and so forth . . . Can I not try to lessen these things?
A:  Where  there  is  a  fertile  field,  weeds  will  grow.  One  may  choose  to  pull  out  the weeds  if  he  so  wishes.  But  he  will  be  doing  so  for  all  his  life.  For  each  time  he removes one, another will sprout in its place.
