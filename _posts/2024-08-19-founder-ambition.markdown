title:  "Founder ambition"
---

Aadit, the CEO of Zepto, compared his company to Amazon and got a lot of ridicule on Twitter. But if you're a founder, it's better to index on outrageous ambitions that get you ridiculed from the outside but rally the troops than to dream small.

Deepinder could be tweaking the homepage conversion of Zomato, but he keeps betting big, first with Hyperpure, then with acquiring and scaling Blinkit, and now with Paytm Insider.

You may have the best team building products, your team can optimise the funnels as much as they can, but if there is no long-term ambition, the next big bet that can change the trajectory of the company, your company will be on the path of slow decline and eventual death.
