title:  "Notes on photography"
---

Last year I did a bunch of Skillshare courses on Photography. You can find my notes below:
- Perspective: low angle, high angle, lateral movement, 1st POV.
- Vantage points: point of focus through lateral lines, geometric and organic.
- Rule of thirds.
- Use background as 2nd subject.
- Use dead space. Show ground to give perception of depth.
- Light: into light, with light, sideways.
- Golden hour is best.
- Fill the frame.
- Storytelling: hero vs what lies ahead, hero vs the world, I am too cool, follow me.
- Combination: vantage point + high angle.
