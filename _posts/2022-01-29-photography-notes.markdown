title:  "Notes on photography"
---

Last year I did a bunch of Skillshare courses, read a few books, and watched a lot of Youtube content on Photography. You can find my notes below:
- Position of the subject is important, but equally important is the position of the photgrapher.
- Perspective: low angle, high angle, lateral movement, 1st POV. Try all angles.
- Vantage points: point of focus through lateral lines, geometric and organic.
- Shoot through something.
- Rule of thirds.
- Use background as 2nd subject.
- Use dead space. Show ground to give perception of depth.
- Light: into light, with light, sideways.
- Utilise the light.
- Golden hour is best.
- Always think framing. Use the environment.
- Fill the frame.
- Everything in the frame should be part of a story you are telling.
- Take multiple shots.
- Pay attention to the borders of your frame. Keep focus on the subject.
- Ask what you want your image to say before you decide how to say it.
- Think what everybody does. Do the opposite for an unique perspective.
- Shoot landscape mode more. You can always turn it into portrait if needed.
- Storytelling: hero vs what lies ahead, hero vs the world, I am too cool, follow me.
- Combination: vantage point + high angle.
