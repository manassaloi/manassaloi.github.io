I have discussed how to set up a product org with multiple founders. My notes can be found below.

Note: The final form is taken from [this](https://www.reforge.com/blog/product-work-beyond-product-market-fit) post by Reforge.

I had not shared this in the past because I wanted to write a long detailed post with my learnings working in various product org structures and how different companies should adopt their own structure instead of copying one randomly, but I have become lazy with my writing. Will try to complete it later.
