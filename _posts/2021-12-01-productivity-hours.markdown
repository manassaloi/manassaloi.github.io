title:  "Why do you want to be productive?"
---

The most important question to ask when you are working on improving your productivity is why do you want to be productive in the first place?  

Productivity is about effeciency; getting more done with your time. If you are being more productive at work and have a few extra hours at the end of the day, how will you spend those hours?

I like being productive with my time so that I don't have to spent all my time at work and can utilise my hours post 7PM on spending time with my wife/ reading books/ advising other startups/ / shitposting on Twitter.

I care about [Pareto'ing my life](spending time with my wife) because I want to do more things in a day. We all have the same number of hours. So unless you know why you want to squeese out a few free ones at the end of the day, you won't focus on building systems that will get you more output from the time spent at work.
