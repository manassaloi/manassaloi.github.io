title:  "How long do I work"
---

As you progress in your career, the emphasis shifts from clocking in set hours to delivering tangible results. There are no strict boundaries on when you should be logged in.

Just last week, a friend who isn't in the tech industry asked me how many hours we typically work given our compensation. It's a tricky question to answer.

Gojek operates in a hybrid work model. Sometimes, I manage to fit in a workout at 6 PM when I'm working from home. On the flip side, I might find myself discussing organizational issues with my manager at 10 PM. Due to time zone differences, there are occasions when I'm on a call as early as 6:30 AM.

Even during vacations, the responsibility doesn't vanish. If something breaks, I have to step in. I vividly recall a time when I was in Cappadocia last year, and my day was meticulously planned. But I had to jump into multiple Zoom calls because an unexpected issue arose.

In this environment, no one dictates your schedule. You define your own OKRs (Objectives and Key Results), set your goals, and determine when and how you achieve them.

Take this tweet, for instance. I'm writing it during a break from working on performance reviews. However, this thread will only take about 5 minutesâ€”similar to the duration of a quick smoke break at the office.

My perspective is simple: as long as I'm accessible and can provide prompt responses (I've set my turnaround time to be within X minutes), and my team and I consistently deliver results, I'm content.
