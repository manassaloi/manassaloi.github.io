title:  "The next crypto unicorn"
---

The next cryptoÂ unicorn will help you buy tokens directly from ICICI Direct (and other banking partners). There is a pretty small window here, from the day Government passes regulations letting legacy players to embrace crypto to the first startup that goes ahead and executes this.

I think Smallcase can do this. All they need to do is embrace crypto. They have ongoing relationships with all major banking partners and their execution over the last few years has been stellar.

I will get pushback from people saying that multiple players already exist who are trying to solve this problem. But multiple players existing does not mean that there is a winner. Today you can't even transfer money easily on Wazirx and other centralised exchanges. I have 4 bank accounts. None of them work when it comes to buying crypto. I got UPI on my HDFC  blocked when I tried to do P2P on binance. So we have a long road ahead.
