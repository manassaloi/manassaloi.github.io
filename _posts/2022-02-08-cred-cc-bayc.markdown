title:  "Cred should launch a Credit Card"
---

Cred should launch a limited edition credit card.
- Invite only.
- Gold color metal card.  
- Accompanying NFT to flex and show status online. Now that Instagram and Twitter will support NFTs.
- CC holders get access to exclusive Discord with other members.
- Maybe offline events too.

A mix of HDFC Infinia + Friends with Benefits + BAYC + VC fund's founders offsite.

Status + FOMO = Ultimate marketing tool.

This is not a new idea. A lot of people have speculated that launching a CC is the end game for Cred.

Status + FOMO has always been my playbook.
- Aristos.
- All my private sessions.
- Dhaniya ventures.

Roll out high quality products with high signal, low noise. Exclusivity. Get people talking. Drive FOMO. People who get in should feel like they are part of something special.
