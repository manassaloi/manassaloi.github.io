title:  "[Product Spec] Emoji Reactions on Twitter Messages"

---

I keep getting Twitter DMs like these regularly

![Product Spec request](/assets/img/request_product_spec.png)

So I decided to spend my afternoon today writing a Product spec for Emoji reactions to Twitter messages (which launched a couple of days back)

You can find the link here: [Emoji Reactions on Twitter Messages](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sUX-sm5qZ474PCQQUpvdi3lvvmWPluqHOyfXz3xKL2M/edit)

Feel free to use this template

**Note:**

+ This is just a product spec. It does not include user flows
+ I am thinking of writing a separate doc with wireframes (on how I would do the reactions feature)
+ Will also write a separate doc on how to prioritise between features
+ My goal is to start from planning OKRs and come down to individual product specs :)
