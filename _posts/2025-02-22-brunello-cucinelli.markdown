title:  "Brunello Cucinelli for X"
---
Brunello Cucinelli's playbook with a different product in a different country is a future 100 million dollar company.

Why it will work:

- A nationalism tailwind.
- High craftsmanship in an increasingly digital world.
- Proof of work in the country and not imported from China.
- Less automation, more human made.
- Story led.
- Community first.
- Premium price point.
- Distribution through storytelling on social media.
- Sell to the Nikhil Kamaths of the country first.

Needs legacy (50+ years of craftsmanship). I'm not the one to build this business, but someone will.

I believe in this concept as much as Shakth Jaw for Tier 3 Gen Z audience.
