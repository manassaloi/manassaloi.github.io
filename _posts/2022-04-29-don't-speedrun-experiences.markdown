title:  "Don't speedrun experiences"
---

Ever since I speed ran Red Dead Redemption 2, I have learned my lesson. There are limited great games, books, tv shows that one can experience in life. Instead of completion, the goal should be to enjoy and make them last till one can.

After Red Dead Redemption 2, Witcher 3, and God of War, I am finding it difficult to enjoy any other game. These 3 were what I consider the peak of gaming experience.

I am currently reading
- A suitable boy
- Golden son

And listening to The Stand by Stephen King.

All 3 highly rated books. And this time trying to read them slowly.
