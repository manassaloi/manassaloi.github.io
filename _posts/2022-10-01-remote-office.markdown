title:  "Why remote work might end"
---

There are people who bring high energy to work. Take ownership. They will always thrive, be it WFH or at office.

Then there are people who think WFH is essentially a holiday and won't reply on Slack unless you escalate to their manager. Remote work will end because of them.

We are already seeing the narrative change from "remote is the future" to "this is not working, lets get back to office."

We are not in 2021 anymore. If companies like Microsoft, Apple, and Google with record cash flows are laying off/ going on hiring freeze/ stressed about employee productivity, your 30% negative CM startup is probably thinking hard too. Think about it.

And yes, please be a bit more active on Slack again.
