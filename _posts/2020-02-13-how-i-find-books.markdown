title: "How I find books to read"

---

A few people have asked me where I find books to read. Apart from finding them on [Goodreads thanks to my friends](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9698257-manas-saloi), I also stalk public book shelves of interesting people.

Here are a few:

- [The Rabbit Hole by Blas Moros](https://blas.com/)

- [Bookschatter](https://bookschatter.com/books/)

- [Maksim Stepanenko's Bookshelf](maksim.ms)

- [Susan Fowler's booklist](susanjfowler.com)

- [Patrick Collison's bookshelf](https://patrickcollison.com/bookshelf)

- [Patrick O’Shaughnessy Book Club/ Bookshelf](http://investorfieldguide.com/bookclub/)

- [Keith Rabois' list](https://www.bookadvice.co/keith-rabois.html)

- [James Somers's list](http://jsomers.net/#books)
