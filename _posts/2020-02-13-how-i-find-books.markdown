title: "How I find books to read"

---

A few people have asked me where I find books to read. Apart from finding them on [Goodreads thanks to my friends](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9698257-manas-saloi), I also stalk public bookshelves of interesting people.

Here are a few:

- [The Rabbit Hole by Blas Moros](https://blas.com/)

- [Bookschatter](https://bookschatter.com/books/)

- [Maksim Stepanenko's Bookshelf](https://maksim.ms)

- [Susan Fowler's booklist](https://susanjfowler.com)

- [Patrick Collison's bookshelf](https://patrickcollison.com/bookshelf)

- [Patrick O’Shaughnessy Book Club/ Bookshelf](http://investorfieldguide.com/bookclub/)

- [Keith Rabois' list](https://www.bookadvice.co/keith-rabois.html)

- [James Somers's list](http://jsomers.net/#books)

I follow a bunch of subreddits: r/booksuggestions, r/ books.

Other useful sites: [Books Read By](https://www.booksread.by/), [BooksChatter](https://bookschatter.com/), [Read Next](https://read-next.com/), [Good books](https://www.goodbooks.io/), [Top Fantasy Reads](https://topfantasyreads.com/), [A year of reading the world](https://ayearofreadingtheworld.com/thelist/), [Which book](https://www.whichbook.net/).
