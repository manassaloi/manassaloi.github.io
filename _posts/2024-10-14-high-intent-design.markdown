title:  "Designing for high intent usecase"
---

You want the transaction to happen as quickly as possible without distracting the user when designing for a high intent product.

For ride-hailing, you want the transaction to happen as quickly as possible for a user who is going to the office in the morning. Reduce the entire journey to a single tap if possible.

For medium intention use cases like food, you as a PM, want the user to feel like they are getting a good deal. So playing on  price perception from home page itself is important. If you are providing a voucher, tell the users they have it and will get a discounted price. If you are running a 1+1 offer for some restaurants and you have tagged a user as price sensitive, try to show case items with that 1+1 offer as early in the funnel as possible.

For ecommerce, as it is low intent you can do gamification as well as other jazz. Let users unlock coupons by spinning a wheel. For apps like Temu the game is to make the user feel like they are getting a good deal and increase their intent to transact.

A lot of Chinese apps lean heavily on gamification. Shoppee and Temu look very different from, say, Zomato or Swiggy. And that is intentional.
