title:  "Why strategy matters"
---

Strategy is a hated word on tech twitter. And it is understandable.

Last 10 years of low interest rates and emphasis on growth over free cashflows meant no one really had to think about strategy.

Strategy is all about trade offs. But why do trade offs between user segments, feature sets, expansion strategy when money was free and your competitors were going after everything anyway. Choosing meant getting left behind. Now with decreasing balance sheets, high cost of capital, you suddenly have to make hard choices.

As one mentor told me: this is the year when everyone in tech will learn to choose and also how to make money.

This makes me excited as a product person inspite of the gloomy macro environment. 

All of us have been executing for years. Saying Yes to everything. Now we learn to say No and choose what really moves the needle for our business.
