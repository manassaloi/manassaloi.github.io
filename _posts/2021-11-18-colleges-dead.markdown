title:  "Are colleges dead?"
---

How to judge if colleges are dead and no one cares about them anymore:
Go through your LinkedIn connections and check how many of them have this in their bio: IIM X, IIT Y. Youâ€™ll have your answer.

Watch what people do and not what they say on Twitter.

Another thing to observe: Are the kids of company execs and VCs building their audience on Twitter by shouting that colleges are dead also dropping out, or are they quietly heading off to their Ivy League education?

Most people come on Twitter to [seek confirmation bias](https://manassaloi.com/2021/09/20/confirmation-bias.html) and signal to their tribe. You can find a longer post on the topic of MBA here: [MBA or not](https://manassaloi.com/2021/01/09/MBA-not.html).

Also why I am grateful I went to [BITS.](https://linkedin.com/pulse/should-you-go-college-manas-j-saloi/)

Not saying you can't make it without a college education or an MBA, just do your own research.
