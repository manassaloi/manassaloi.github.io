title:  "Colleges are dead?"
---

How to judge if colleges are dead and no one cares about them anymore: Go to your LinkedIn connections and check how many of them have this: IIM X, IIT Y on their bio. You will have your answer.

See what people do instead of what you read on Twitter.

Another thing to observe: Are kids of company execs and VCs creating their distribution on Twitter (shouting colleges are dead) or are they going for their Ivy league education?

Most people come on Twitter to [seek confirmation bias](https://manassaloi.com/2021/09/20/confirmation-bias.html) and signal to their tribe. You can find a longer post on the topic of MBA here: [MBA or not](https://manassaloi.com/2021/01/09/MBA-not.html).

Also why I am grateful I went to [BITS](https://linkedin.com/pulse/should-you-go-college-manas-j-saloi/)

Not saying you can't make it without a college education or an MBA, just do your own research.
