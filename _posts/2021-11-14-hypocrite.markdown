title:  "Am I a hypocrite?"
---

I don't have analytics on my website. You won't find any link to my Twitter from this website. I like to think I don't care about my Twitter, I am beyond distribution games, and I write for the sake of putting my thoughts across.

But while writing my GPM promo doc, I did go to similarweb and got the traffic info. Just so that I could write "Manas Saloi is a product thought leader whose website gets 200K visits per month. He has mentored dozens of PMs in the industry and advises startups."

Why did I do that? Because for promotion to a Group Product Manager level, you have to show impact beyond Gojek.

Does this make me a hypocrite? Maybe. I have been honest about not being consistent with my thoughts. I have changed my mind on [a bunch of things](https://manassaloi.com/2020/04/01/strong-opinions-weakly-held.html). I don't think I have a lot of strong opinions. 

As [BroductManager tweeted](https://twitter.com/BroductManager/status/1441503972947206146), there is no alpha in ideological consistency. But I atleast try to understand my hypocrisy and my biases. Do deeper on why I am the way I am. Why I believe what I believe. 

I recommend you all to do the same. If you have a strong opinion, then ask why. See if you can argue the opposite side. 

I constantly tweet about Wanting and The elephant in the brain, and others. Go to the Meta reading section [here](https://manassaloi.com/bookshelf/). These books will draw a visceral reaction from you. They are not pleasant to read.

Go deeper beyond the initial visceral reaction and you will have a deeper understanding of the world.
