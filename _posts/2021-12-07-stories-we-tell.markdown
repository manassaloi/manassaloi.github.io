title:  "The stories we tell"
---

I was talking to a friend who was worried about pitching to a crypto startup. He told me about feeling imposter syndrome. He was arguing to himself against applying. His point was that most crypto startups hire builders while he is a PM. Why would anyone in web3 hire him. What value can he add? My argument was "How many people have worked at a startup at scale and one that has been invested by Google?" The value he will add as someone who helped a startup scale is unparalleled. The startup he worked at is known by everyone in India. And for web3 startups it is always a positive story if they can hire more builders who have moved from web2; it further validates their hypotheses that what they are working on is actually the future.

I can understand where he is coming from. We are the stories we tell others, and most of all ourselves. For the longest period of time, I was a master of telling failure stories. Then one day I was chatting with my manager here at Gojek and he told me that he hires people who have had a growth trajectory; he was impressed with how I started with CouponDunia and every role and company I joined subsequently was a step up. I was surprised. In my head most of the products I worked at previously did not even have 10% of the scale of Gojek. I actually pitied myself for always choosing the "wrong companies." If only I had done X vs Y was a constant thought in my head.

So I changed the frame with which how I looked at my past.

All of the things mentioned below are true, but the stories are different.

*I worked for the biggest loyalty startup in India that was acquired by Times Internet; I built a new business line for them that scaled to 25% of their revenue within a year of launch.*

vs

*Aah, No one remember CouponDunia anymore. Who cares what I did.*


*I was the Product Owner of both Android and iOS mobile apps at Craftsvilla, a USD200M e-commerce company funded by global investors such as Sequoia, Lightspeed, and Nexus Venture Partners.*

vs

*Craftsvilla never lived up to its potential.*


*I worked for a bootstrapped unicorn that has run and sold multiple successful product lines; combined sum of a few of them sold exceeds 1B; the product suite that I worked on (has since pivoted) and is now worth multiple hundred millions.*

vs

*Flock did not become as big as Slack, maybe I was better of choosing company X instead of Directi.*

Tell the better story to yourself. It will not just define who you are, but also who you become.
