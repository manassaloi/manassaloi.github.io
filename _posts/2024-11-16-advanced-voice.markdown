title:  "Advanced voice"
---

Claude models are much better at coding than OpenAI models.

But I pay OpenAI just to use Advanced voice. I was never a big fan of voice as an input. Can't live without it now.

I even got people to pay for ChatGPT Premium by showing them the things they can do with Advanced Voice.

- Let it act as your therapist.
- Use it as a thinking partner for projects.
- Prep for interivews.
- I once told someone that they needed to appear more confident for management interviews and they could use Advanced Voice to act as a coach and get feedback on how to appear more confident and have it rate their answers. And guess what: Advanced voice did the job.

It is amazing and well worth the $20 per month fee.
