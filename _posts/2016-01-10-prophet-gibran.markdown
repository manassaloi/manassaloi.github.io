**This blogpost is not an exhaustive summary of the book. Just contains the notes I took.** 

- And think not you can direct the course of love, for love, if it finds you worthy, directs your course.

- Love teaches you to:
  - To bleed willingly and joyfully.
  - To wake at dawn with a winged heart and give thanks for another day of loving.
  - To sleep with a prayer for the beloved in your heart and song of praise upon your lips.

- The deeper the sorrow carves into your being the more joy you can contain.

- When you are joyous , look deep into your heart and you shall find it is only that has given you sorrow that is giving you joy.

- Your house shall not be an anchor but a mast.

- You shall not dwell in tombs made by the dead for the living.

- For that which is boundless in you abides in the mansion of the sky, whose door is the morning mist, and whose windows are the songs and the silences of night.

- And if it is fear you would dispel , the seat of that fear is in your heart and not in the hand of the feared.

- Much of your pain is self chosen.

- Your pain is the breaking of the shell that encloses your understanding.

- Even as the stone of the fruit must break, that its heart may stand in the sun, so must you know pain.

- For self is a sea boundless and measureless.

- When you part from your friend; you grieve not; For that which you love most in them may be clearer from their absence, as the mountain to the climber is clearer from the plain.

- And let there be no purpose in friendship save the deepening of the spirit.

- For in the dew of little things the heart finds its morning and is refreshed.

- You talk when you cease to be at peace with your thoughts.

- And when you can no longer dwell in the solitude of your heart you live in your lips, and sound is a diversion and a past time.

- And in much of your talking, thinking is half murdered.

- There are those among you who seek the talkative through fear of being alone.

- And there are those who have the truth within them, but they tell it not in words.

- You know that yesterday is but today's memory and tomorrow  is today's dream. And let today embrace the past with remembrance and the future with longing.

- Your daily life is your temple and religion.
