Heirarchy of splash screens:
1. Selling the most important product at the moment (have seen very few companies do this, see Zepto selling their subscription).
2. Reinforce key information (say location, see Swiggy for example).
3. Communicate positioning (see Blinkit).
4. Cool animation/ just load home fast (see Uber).
5. Just logo (standard for most companies, but a waste opportunity IMHO).
