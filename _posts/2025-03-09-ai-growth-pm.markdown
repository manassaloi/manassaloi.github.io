title:  "Best time to be a growth PM"
---

There's never been a better time to be a growth PM for a big company. Every day, I come up with dozens of top-of-the-funnel mini-product ideas. Great for user acquisition, but not quite full-fledged startup material.

A decade ago, I used to get inbound offers to build these for existing companies. Think: a credit score checker as a lead gen tool for a lending app. Back then, the cost of building such products was still high. I was not sure if leadership would be invested in the long term. How many bets would they take? What if they shut down the team after one failed launch? Now with Gen AI, the cost is almost zero.

Actually, it is not just top of the funnel. You can do products for engagement too. Spotify wrapped for other products. Mini-gamified surveys. Endless possibilities.
