title:  "Taste of Indian founders"
---

I saw a tweet on the taste of Indian founders.

As I wrote in a post earlier, it is one of the most overused words today and everyone thinks they have it.

Fold Money probably has the best onboarding experience anywhere in the world. You can compare globally. We see Family (now part of Coinbase) and think "wow, impressive taste."

Fold Money does not get the recognition because constantly online valley taste makers will never get their hands on it.
Swiggy and Zomato can compete globally with any on-demand app on taste.

Cred has "taste." Yes, you might disagree on some of their design decisions. You can discuss UI vs UX. But I know people there. They spend weeks perfecting small details people won't even notice.

Zerodha products are well designed.

I could list many more examples.

We don't have Deep Research because of other reasons and not "taste."
