title:  "Story points productivity"
---

As a process enjooyer, there was a time when I was obsessed with measuring productivity. If the velocity of Jira story points went up, I was happy; if it went down, our team did extreme retros. It was the worst thing I could have done.

We went from a small team that got shit done fast to a team where everyone was trying to game the system. There were always debates about how to measure the complexity of a feature.

Also do you get points for everything you do as a developer?

The developers started saying "Hey, I spent all this time doing ADR reviews, that time needs to be counted". "What about the 3 interviews I did yesterday? If they are not contributing to points (and therefore my productivity), why should I take them?"

It was crazy how the whole dynamic of the team changed. We learnt and course corrected quickly.

You know if a team is performing or not. When they are doing their best. And giving their all. Obsessing over story points and lead times and is just going to create unnecessary politics. Just avoid it.
