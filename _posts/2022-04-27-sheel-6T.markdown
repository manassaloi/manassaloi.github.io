title:  "Sheel Mohnot's 6T framework"
---

I found this framework to invest in startups interesting, so adding it to my blog. Sheel mentioned it in a podcast that I listened to. Don't remember

- Team
  - Most important, especially the founder.
  - Is the future they are articulating clear?
  - Can they bring in a strong culture that brings customers?)
- Traction
  - What have they built so far?
  - Have they figured out cac?
  - Got any partnerships?
  - Crossed regulatory hurdles?
- Tech
  - Can this team build a great product?
  - Are they iterating on the product fast?
- Trends and TAM
  - Are the trends in their favor?
  - If they execute perfectly how big can it get? Can it go to 1B?
- Terms
  - Are the founders being reasonable when it comes to valuation and dilution? Min 10% ownership needed for me to make the math work.
- Time
  - Do I like this founder as a person?
  - Do I want to spend my nights if needed with them?
  - Can I jam with them?
