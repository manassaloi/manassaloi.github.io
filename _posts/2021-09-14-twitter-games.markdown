Things I have done to take Twitter less seriously
- Wrote [Twitter rules](https://manassaloi.com/2020/01/17/twitter-rules.html).
- Don't have notifications turned on. Just search for my name on Twitter so that I can find tweets I am tagged in.
- Turn my [Twitter private](https://manassaloi.com/2021/04/20/taking-twitter-private.html) from time to time.
- Literally told people to [unfollow me](https://manassaloi.com/2020/04/13/unfollow-me.html).
- Gave my wife access to my Twitter account.
- Tried everything I could to [cut usage](https://manassaloi.com/2020/04/17/cutting-down-twitter.html).
- [Told people to do the same](https://manassaloi.com/2020/05/30/three-months-since.html).
- Delete my tweets everyday.
- Wrote why [Twitter is bad for career growth](https://manassaloi.com/2021/03/05/alex-cohen-twitter.html).
- Shit on people who QT me.
- Always optimise on: fighting less on Twitter. I always try to post a nuanced view even if the twitter algorithm rewards the most one sided unhinged views.
- Care less about follower than posting what I am actually thinking about.
- Deleted 'follow me on twitter' footer from all my blogposts a few months back. I even removed the link to my Twitter account from my homepage. I actually did control F on Atom to make sure there is no single link to my Twitter account.

All of these are silly little games I have played to get rid of Twitter. I wish I could just delete my fucking account and move on with my life. I even tried doing that. It takes 30 days to delete permanently. 20 days into the deactivation process, a friend made some solid arguments on why having a Twitter account still has upside. Maybe deep down I wanted to remain. So I reactivated. 6 months later, I am still arguing with people there.

Why I still use twitter
- Ego. I somehow keep thinking that a single thread I write might help someone take a big life or career decision. Yes, I am that vain.
- People DM'ing me thanking me for my tweets makes me think they are/ I am important.
- Dopamine hits. I don't post on any other social media.
- Career growth. I spent yesterday complaining about titles and calling most leaders winner of the startup lottery. By night I had a CEO reach out to me with a job offer. Though I will continue to say that Twitter should remain far down the priorities one should have if they want to have a successful tech career, but it does help at some level.
- I can complain about companies if I am unhappy and sadly it is the only platform where customer service folks listen to escalations. Also, don't have Facebook. So where else will I complain if my Amazon order is very late?
- I have made a few really good friends from Twitter. No matter how much I shit on networking, I would have fewer people in my life without Twitter.
