I am trying a new way of retaining what I read: Creating graphs and 2*2 matrices.

Here are a few couple of examples.

- I read about Frequency vs Coverage for transportation systems from [this book](https://goodreads.com/book/show/44451608-better-buses-better-cities). According to the author, the ideal transportation medium should cover both.

Here is a 2*2 matrix I drew for the area I live in.

- I listened to a [podcast](https://player.fm/series/venture-stories/the-art-of-great-management-with-alex-maccaw) recently where the author spoke about an interesting thing about hiring.

He said Most founders think they are doing C and D, while the reality is A and B.

- Premium vs Economy

This is something I have been thinking a lot. How do you make sure the ticket size increases for a high frequency but low ticket size business like ride hailing?

It is by making people move to a Premium category.

How do you create a Premium category?

Now that I think more on this, maybe Average Car quality and Good Drivers can become a Budget category.
