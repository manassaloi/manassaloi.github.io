title:  "Crush in your first two months"
---

I saw this reel about how you should put 70% effort into your first few months as a new employee so you don't overdeliver and set super high expectations that are unsustainable.

I disagree.

The first couple of months set a lot of how we are perceived by others. And perception is what becomes reality.

If people perceive you as a winner - as someone who can get shit done - then you will start to get good projects at the beginning of your tenure. A few early wins and you're in.

If, on the other hand, you move slowly, don't bring energy, under-communicate, then you're setting yourself up for failure and that first impression is hard to change later on.

When someone joins my team, this is the first thing I tell them. And it is the only reason why I myself have always had a high level of approval from my managers.
