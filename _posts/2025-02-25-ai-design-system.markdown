title:  "Glass like design system"
---

I really like the vibe of Nous Research. I collect different design styles out of interest.

I loved [this site](https://www.neobrutalism.dev/) that has a collection of neobrutalism-styled components based on shadcn.

But I am lazy. I am never going to spend time on something like this, building it from scratch.

Then I saw Pietro share how he created a "glass-like" design system in [one shot](https://x.com/skirano/status/1894171599508537620), with all the components. I got super excited and tried to do the same thing with Grok-3, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and O3-mini.

It seemed boring to copy something already done. So I started asking myself what style would be cool. Can I get inspired by Mughal architecture? Can I try some Persian style? Maybe some Japanese style?

After a long discussion with all these LLMs, I came up with a few design systems, but none were as cool as the neobrutalism site. I will probably keep trying these experiments until I come up with something interesting.
