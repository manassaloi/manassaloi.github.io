title:  "Twitter gurus"
---

Twitter has ruined thought leader gurus for me. In the 18th century Naval could have been a philosopher guru with his gyaan.

But the fact that he spends all his time on Twitter, arguing with people, hiding replies he does not like, makes me ask if he actually follows his own advice. Like if I was as successful, rich, and wise, will I bother with Twitter? Also, he literally changed his Twitter strategy over the years when he realised pithy tweets work best when it comes to building distribution.

Same with Kapil Gupta, Naval's performance guru and friend. I read Atmanun and my mind was blown. I was fascinated by the guy. Then I saw his reply to Ali Abdaal's tweet and the whole fascination went away. It was how someone trying too hard to be a guru would reply.

Imagine Swami Vivekananda on Twitter: blocking people, QTing, hiding replies. And you knew which political party he supported. Who his friends are. His enemies. I doubt people would follow his path.

If you want to be a Guru, you have to get away from Twitter and remain in Celebristan. The closer you come to the masses, the lesser your appeal and you end up doing things that break the mimetic wall between you and your followers.

Peter Thiel, not a guru, but a student of mimesis, knows this. That is why he is off Twitter.
