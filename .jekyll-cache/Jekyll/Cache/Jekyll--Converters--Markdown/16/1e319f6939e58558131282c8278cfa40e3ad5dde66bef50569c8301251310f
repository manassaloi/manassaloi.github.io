I"†<p>I like to believe I was channeling Bill when I came up with my favorite question to ask my direct reports back at Joie de Vivre and then at Airbnb, ‚ÄúHow can I support you to do the best work of your life here?‚Äù This question not only gave those who worked for me the sense that I wanted them to succeed, it also put some responsibility in their laps to help fashion a working relationship that would encourage them to make suggestions on how to improve their performance, rather than play the role of victim if they felt stymied in their career</p>
