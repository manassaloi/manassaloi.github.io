  <li>The general composition of my emails,â€ Ferriss said, â€œwhen Iâ€™m emailing a busy person, is:
    <blockquote>
      <p>Dear So-and-So,
I know youâ€™re really busy and that you get a lot of emails, so this will only take sixty seconds to read.
[Here is where you say who you are: add one or two lines that establish your credibility.]
[Here is where you ask your very specific question.]
I totally understand if youâ€™re too busy to respond, but even a one- or two-line reply would really make my day.			
All the best,
Tim</p>

Subject: Mr. Bisnowâ€”I could really use some advice from you
Hi Mr. Bisnow,
My name is Alex and Iâ€™m a sophomore at USC. I know this is pretty out-of-the-blue, but Iâ€™m a big fan of yours and I could really use your advice on a project Iâ€™m working on. I know youâ€™re really busy and that you get a lot of emails, so this will only take sixty seconds to read.
My story is that Iâ€™m a nineteen-year-old who is writing a book with the hope of changing the dynamic of my generation. The book will feature some of the worldâ€™s most successful people and will focus on what they were doing early on in their careers to get to where they are today. Iâ€™m truly humbled by the people who have already jumped on board for this missionâ€”from Microsoft president Qi Lu to author Tim Ferriss. Iâ€™m determined to combine the greats from the older generation along with the new generation, and integrate their wisdom and practical advice into one book that changes peopleâ€™s lives. Like you say, â€œmake no small plansâ€ :)
Mr. Bisnow, being nineteen years old and pursuing my vision does have some obstacles, so it would be unbelievably helpful to get some guidance from you on the topic of: How did you effectively bring all these luminaries together behind a single vision? You did it masterfully with your first ski trip in 2008, and youâ€™ve continued to do it better and better as the years have gone on.
Iâ€™m sure youâ€™re really busy, but if there is any chance we can connect so I can soak up some guidance, that would mean the world to me. If youâ€™d  like, I could field some specific questions your way via email, we can talk via telephone for a few minutes, or if your schedule permits, Iâ€™d love to meet you either at a coffee shop, orâ€¦if the planets alignâ€¦at the world-famous Summit House :)
I totally understand if youâ€™re too busy to respond, but even a one- or two-line reply would really make my day.
Dreaming big,
Alex</p>

    <p>He said to buy twenty books similar to the one I wanted to write, study the acknowledgments, and make notes of whom the authors thanked as their agents. I spent weeks compiling my list, researching what other books the agents represented and determining which agents might be best.</p>

    <p>At the tournament, he met a Goldman Sachs executive who said he might be able to get his firm to sponsor the second Summit event. Elliott told him Goldman didnâ€™t even have to pay as long as Elliott could put the firmâ€™s logo on the â€œsponsorsâ€ page of the event website. Elliott then called other companies and said, â€œLook, itâ€™s almost impossible to get to be a sponsor of Summit right now. Weâ€™re working with very few companies, and our most recent client is Goldman Sachs, so if you want to be serious, letâ€™s be serious. Weâ€™re only working with the best.â€ It was another example of Borrowed Credibility. That Goldman Sachs relationship enabled Elliott to lock in other sponsors, which led to a lot of the eventual success of Summit.</p>

    <p>â€œThis is the thing,â€ I told Corwin. â€œAlthough people wonâ€™t meet with you for the reason you want, that doesnâ€™t mean they wonâ€™t meet at all. Just find another angle. Figure out what they need and use that as your way in.â€</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>â€œItâ€™s like what Elliott told me,â€ I said. â€œOne path leads to a linear life, the other an exponential.â€</p>

    <p>The lesson: figure out your opponentâ€™s fears, then use them to your advantage.</p>
  </li>
  <li>â€œDonâ€™t send Zuckerberg another email,â€ Elliott said.
â€œBut shouldnâ€™t I confirm?â€ I asked.
  â€œNo. Never oversell. He already said yes. At this point, all you have to do is show up.â€</li>
