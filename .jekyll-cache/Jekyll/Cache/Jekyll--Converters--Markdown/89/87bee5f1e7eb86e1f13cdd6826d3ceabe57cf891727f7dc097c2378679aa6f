I"­<p>It is surprising that it has been 2.5 years since Google Pay launched in India, and they canâ€™t still figure out how to do contact search properly inside the application. How hard can it be to map the contact name you have set in your phonebook with the personâ€™s UPI id? Also remember that Google owns Android and all the contact data that comes with it.</p>

<p>See what happens when you type â€œdadâ€, â€œmomâ€ on Google Pay. Now compare with PhonePeâ€™s search</p>

<p>Here is me searching for my brother on both Google Pay, and PhonePe</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/gpay_phonepe.png" alt="Google Pay vs Phonpe" /></p>

<p>My brotherâ€™s nickname is Captain, if that is not clear. See how PhonePe searches for the keyword â€œCaptainâ€ returns the result, and even shows the real name as confirmation, while Google Pay search fails</p>

<p>Google Payâ€™s success rate when it comes to transactions is far behind Phonepeâ€™s. The least they can do is fix their user experience. A clutter-free homepage is a great start. But you expect more from a company like Google</p>
