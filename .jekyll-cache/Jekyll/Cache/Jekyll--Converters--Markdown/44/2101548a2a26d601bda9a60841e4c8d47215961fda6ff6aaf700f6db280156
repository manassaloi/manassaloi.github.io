I"ù<p>One of the good things about being a Gyaandu: Some people take you seriously and note down your gyaan. I was doing an 1-1 session with a candidate from Aristos recently. Afterwards he asked me if I wanted to share the notes he took with the rest of the world. I was like why not. A new blogpost where I wonâ€™t have to think about new content sounds amazing. So I am just copy pasting his notes here (with minor edits. minor edits = me mostly taking out the â€œ.â€ at the end of random sentences)</p>
