I"§<p><strong>Note:</strong> While reading a book whenever I come across something interesting, I highlight it on my Kindle. Later I turn those highlights into a blogpost. It is not a complete summary of the book. These are my notes which I intend to go back to later. Letâ€™s start!</p>

<p>The very first thing I tell my new students on the first day of a workshop is that good writing is about telling the truth.</p>

<p>So you might start by writing down every single thing you can remember from your first few years in school. Start with kindergarten. Try to get the words and memories down as they occur to you. Donâ€™t worry if what you write is no good, because no one is going to see it.</p>

<p>I remember to pick up the one-inch picture frame and to figure out a one-inch piece of my story to tell, one small scene, one memory, one exchange. I also remember a story that I know Iâ€™ve told elsewhere but that over and over helps me to get a grip</p>

<p>We are just going to take this bird by bird. But we are going to finish this one short assignment.</p>

<p>Think of the basket of each characterâ€™s life: what holds the ectoplasm togetherâ€”what are this personâ€™s routines, beliefs? What little things would your characters write in their journals: I ate this, I hate that, I did this, took the dog for a long walk, I chatted with my neighbor. This is all the stuff that tethers them to the earth and to other people, all the stuff that makes each character think that life sort of makes sense.</p>

<p>Plot is the main story of your book or short story.</p>

<p>Your plot will fall into place as, one day at a time, you listen to your characters carefully, and watch them move around doing and saying things and bumping into each other. Youâ€™ll see them influence each otherâ€™s lives, youâ€™ll see what they are capable of up and doing, and youâ€™ll see them come to various ends.</p>

<p>Drama is the way of holding the readerâ€™s attention. The basic formula for drama is setup, buildup, payoffâ€”just like a joke. The setup tells us what the game is. The buildup is where you put in all the moves, the forward motion, where you get all the meat off the turkey. The payoff answers the question, Why are we here anyway? What is it that youâ€™ve been trying to give?</p>

<p>For the climax, there must be a killing or a healing or a domination.</p>

<p>She said that sometimes she uses a formula when writing a short story, which goes ABDCE, for Action, Background, Development, Climax, and Ending.</p>

<p>You begin with action that is compelling enough to draw us in, make us want to know more. Background is where you let us see and know who these people are, how theyâ€™ve come to be together, what was going on before the opening of the story. Then you develop these people, so that we learn what they care most about. The plotâ€”the drama, the actions, the tensionâ€”will grow out of that. You move them along until everything comes together in the climax, after which things are different for the main characters, different in some real way. And then there is the ending: what is our sense of who these people are now, what are they left with, what happened, and what did it mean?</p>

<p>Almost all good writing begins with terrible first efforts. You need to start somewhere. Start by getting somethingâ€” anythingâ€”down on paper. A friend of mine says that the first draft is the down draftâ€”you just get it down.
The second draft is the up draftâ€”you fix it up. You try to say what you have to say more accurately. And the third draft is the dental draft, where you check every tooth, to see if itâ€™s loose or cramped or decayed, or even, God help us, healthy</p>

<p>If you are a writer, or want to be a writer, this is how you spend your daysâ€”listening, observing, storing things away, making your isolation pay off. You take home all youâ€™ve taken in, all that youâ€™ve overheard, and you turn it into gold. (Or at least you try.)</p>

<p>Second, remember that you should be able to identify each character by what he or she says. Each one must sound different from the others. And they should not all sound like you; each one must have a self. If you can get their speech mannerisms right, you will know what theyâ€™re wearing and driving and maybe thinking, and how they were raised, and what they feel. You need to trust yourself to hear what they are saying over what you are saying. At least give each of them a shot at expression: sometimes what they are saying and how they are saying it will finally show you who they are and what is really happening</p>

<p>Writing is about learning to pay attention and to communicate what is going on.</p>

<p>If you donâ€™t believe in what you are saying, there is no point in your saying it</p>

<p>Writing is about hypnotizing yourself into believing in yourself, getting some work done, then unhypnotizing yourself and going over the material coldly. There will be many mistakes, many things to take out and others that need to be added. You just arenâ€™t always going to make the right decision.</p>

<p>All the good stories are out there waiting to be told in a fresh, wild way</p>
