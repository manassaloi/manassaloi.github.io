I"»<p>â€œWhat kind of PM do you want yourself to be known as here at Gojek?â€ This is a question my manager asked during a 1-1 I had with him a year back</p>

<p>My answer to his question as far as I remember was â€œSomeone who has a high bias for action, good with data, and designâ€</p>

<p>His follow up question to that was â€œWhat are you doing this quarter to justify that reputation?â€</p>

<p>TBH I had not thought much about it. If I wanted to be known as a PM with a great eye for design, were my projects reflecting that? If I wanted to be known as a data-driven PM, what were the key insights I uncovered which justified that reputation?Â </p>

<p>Most of us just pass through our career never bothering to build a reputation as someone who is good with X. Forget building a reputation, we donâ€™t even bother questioning what aspects of a role we want to be really good at.</p>

<p>Most people would think of this as an exercise to answer this question well during interviews. I think it is much more important than that. It is the answer you want others to tell about you too!</p>
