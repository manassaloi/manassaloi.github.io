<h4 id="super-hosts">Super hosts</h4>

<p>If you hit a certain series of performance metricsâ€”in the past year, if you have hosted at least ten trips, if you have maintained a 90 percent response rate or higher, if you have received a five-star review at least 80 percent of the time, and if youâ€™ve canceled a reservation only rarely or in extenuating circumstances, you are automatically elevated to â€œSuperhostâ€ status. That means you get a special logo on your site, your listing will be bumped way up in the rankings, youâ€™ll get access to a dedicated customer-support line, and you might even get the chance to preview new products and attend events</p>

<h4 id="demos-and-idea-lab">Demos and Idea Lab</h4>

<p>It was time to start moving into those other â€œframes,â€ and soon it was decided that Gebbia would run an immersive prototyping exercise to start exploring how. He pulled together six people in design, product, and engineering and moved them all to New York City for three months, a timeline and setup modeled after Y Combinator. (They even drafted their own core values.) Living and working around the clock out of an Airbnb loft in Brooklyn, they hacked together several different in-app tools, outfitted a small group of international Airbnb tourists with phones that contained the jerry-rigged software, and sent them out to test their ideas. At the end of the three months, they would have a Demo Day back at Airbnb headquarters. The concepts they tested were all over the map: an â€œarrival tracker,â€ a sort of Uberlike geolocator that made it easier for the host to know when to expect the guest to check in; a â€œsmart house manualâ€; and something called Local Companion, a virtual-assistant tool that let travelers request anything they needed, whether a local restaurant recommendation, food delivery, or answers to questions about the city</p>

<p>It also had a â€œmagic buttonâ€ users could tap to get an unknown, ultracustomized experience that would be tailored to their interests. One traveler who was a licensed pilot hit the button and got a helicopter ride above Manhattan; another got a custom nail manicurist who came to her door. A third asked for help planning his engagement, a challenge the Local Companion team took up with glee, organizing a post-proposal carriage ride in Central Park complete with a harpist; dinner and a night out; and brunch the next day where, instead of a bill, the waiter presented them with a photo album documenting their experience</p>

<h4 id="elephants-dead-fish-and-vomit">Elephants, Dead fish, and Vomit</h4>

<p>He then introduced a theory heâ€™d learned. Called â€œelephants, dead fish, and vomit,â€ it was a set of tools designed to encourage difficult conversations: An â€œelephant,â€ he explained, is a big truth everyone knows but doesnâ€™t talk about; a â€œdead fishâ€ is a personal grievance that needs to be aired out, usually with an apology, or it risks getting worse (â€œI had quite a few dead fish to deal with,â€ he told the audience); and â€œvomitâ€ sessions were time put aside for people to get things off their chest without interruption and without risk of judgment</p>

<h4 id="storyboarding">Storyboarding</h4>

<p>With the help of professional animators, they â€œstoryboardedâ€ the Airbnb experience, detailing â€œframe by frameâ€ what happened for both traveler and host from the moment a customer first logged on to the site to the moment he or she returned home from a trip. The big revelation from the project was that Airbnb itself was part of only a few of the frames, those that involved the accommodations, and they needed to work to fill in the rest of them. Months later, at the off-site, the founders realized they hadnâ€™t been making enough progress toward that expanded vision for the future of the company: to own not just the accommodations but the full trip</p>

<h4 id="activity-map">Activity map</h4>

<p>In the summer of 2014, after the executive team was beginning to realize the company wasnâ€™t fully aligned on its many initiatives and goals, Blecharczyk started an â€œactivity mapâ€ to document every project being worked on throughout the company. He identified 110 of them, but they were extremely fragmented, with different executives overseeing multiple projects in the same area. He then did a deep analytical study of the companyâ€™s growth, which made him more acutely aware of the imbalance between Airbnbâ€™s limited supply (hosts) and its fast-growing demand (guests)</p>

<h4 id="company-eras">Company eras</h4>

<p>Musk cautioned him against becoming a company that gets so big that it enters what he calls the â€œadministration eraâ€: a phase of 10 or 20 percent growth that a company settles into after the â€œcreation eraâ€ and then the â€œbuilding eraâ€ and signals a mature business. â€œAirbnb will never be in an administration era,â€ Chesky vows. â€œIt will always be in a building era. It will always be in a phase 1, phase 2 era. And this is why weâ€™re going to be launching a lot of stuff in Novemberâ€”and then many, many things after that.â€</p>
