I"”	<p><strong>Note:</strong> While reading a book whenever I come across something interesting, I highlight it on my Kindle. Later I turn those highlights into a blogpost. It is not a complete summary of the book. These are my notes which I intend to go back to later. Letâ€™s start!</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>When conducting business, I was so soft-spoken I made people inch their chairs closer</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I started talking up the project. Nothing in Hollywood is anything until itâ€™s something, and the only way to make it something is with a profound display of belief. If you keep insisting that a shifting set of inchoate possibilities is a movie, it eventually becomes one. Sometimes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Flipping the frame to emphasize the positive and to spark Daveâ€™s competitive nature, I said, â€œIf you go to CBS, youâ€™ll have the chance to beat NBCâ€™s pants off.â€</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remember him pointing to the display of Seagramâ€™s Seven in a storeâ€”at eye level, the best position. â€œPower is all about shelf space,â€ heâ€™d say. â€œAnd to get shelf space, youâ€™ve got to be big.â€</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was also impressed by an Errol Flynn western where he drew a line in the dirt during a mutiny and said, â€œYouâ€™re either with me or against me.â€ That formulationâ€”youâ€™re totally in or totally outâ€”became my mantra</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After I won that election, my father told me, â€œIf you want to be treated like a king, you have to act like one.â€</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I had a strong rÃ©sumÃ©, but Herbâ€™s referral really helped. That was my first lesson in the business: who you know matters</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>CAA had four commandments:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Never lie to your clients or colleagues.</li>
      <li>Return every call by end of day (or at least have your assistant buy you a dayâ€™s grace).</li>
      <li>Follow up and donâ€™t leave people guessing. Every desk phone at CAA bore the message COMMUNICATE. After our Fred Specktor heard me use that word in every speech I gave, he stuck the plaques on Ronâ€™s phone and mineâ€”and when we admired them, he stuck them on everyoneâ€™s phone. It was our version of IBMâ€™s famous imperative to THINK.</li>
      <li>Never bad-mouth the competition</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
